Question:

Following their law school graduation party, a graduate and his roommate were driving home in an automobile that was owned and operated by the graduate. As they were approaching an intersection, their vehicle collided with a motorcycle whose rider was seriously injured in the accident. The rider sued the graduate for operating his motor vehicle in excess of the speed limit. In addition, the roommate brought suit against the rider for operating his motorcycle negligently and driving through a red light. The roommate subsequently reached an out- of-court settlement with the graduate and dismissed the lawsuit against him. At trial against the rider, the roommate testified that he observed the rider drive his motorcycle through a red light and then swerve into the path of the graduate's automobile. In rebuttal, the rider offered into evidence the roommate's complaint against the graduate alleging that the latter was driving "at an excessively high rate of speed at the time the accident occurred. "The complaint is

Options:

A: admissible under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.
B: inadmissible, because it is considered hearsay.
C: admissible as a declaration against interest.
D: admissible, because the graduate consented to its use.
E: inadmissible, because the roommate is not a party to the lawsuit.
F: inadmissible, because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise.
G: admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.
H: admissible as a prior inconsistent statement.
I: admissible as an admission.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is about a car accident involving a graduate and his roommate. The graduate was driving his car, and they collided with a motorcycle rider who was seriously injured. The rider sued the graduate for speeding, and the roommate sued the rider for negligence, including driving through a red light.

The roommate settled with the graduate and dismissed his lawsuit. Then, at trial against the rider, the roommate testified that he saw the rider run a red light and swerve into the car. In rebuttal, the rider tried to introduce the roommate's complaint against the graduate, which alleged that the graduate was driving "at an excessively high rate of speed at the time the accident occurred."

The question is whether this complaint is admissible. The options are A through I, each suggesting a different hearsay exception or reason for inadmissibility.

First, I need to recall the rules about hearsay and exceptions. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If the statement falls under an exception, it's admissible.

The roommate's complaint is being offered by the rider in rebuttal. The roommate testified about what he saw, so the rider is trying to impeach that testimony by showing the roommate's prior statement (in the complaint) that the graduate was speeding. This could suggest that the roommate's testimony might be biased or incorrect.

I think the key here is whether the complaint is admissible as a prior inconsistent statement. Prior inconsistent statements can be used for impeachment, but they must meet certain criteria. For a prior inconsistent statement to be admissible, it must have been made under oath, such as in a deposition or prior testimony, or in a written statement that was subject to perjury penalties.

In this case, the roommate's complaint was part of a lawsuit, so it's a written statement, but I'm not sure if it's subject to the same rules as a deposition. Also, the roommate settled with the graduate and dismissed his lawsuit, so the complaint might be considered part of a dismissed case. But for prior inconsistent statements, the statement just needs to be inconsistent and given under oath. I think a complaint is a sworn document, so it might count.

Another angle: could this be an admission? Admissions by a party opponent are not considered hearsay. But the roommate isn't a party to the current lawsuit; the parties are the rider suing the graduate, and the roommate is a plaintiff in a separate case. So the roommate's statement wouldn't be an admission by a party opponent; that exception is for statements by the opposing party, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, could it be a declaration against interest? That exception applies when a statement is against the declarant's interest at the time it was made. Here, the roommate's complaint was against the graduate, so maybe it's against the roommate's interest. Wait, but declarations against interest require that the declarant is unavailable as a witness. The roommate is testifying, so that exception doesn't apply.

What about the former testimony exception? That applies when a witness's prior testimony is used, but the roommate's complaint isn't testimony; it's a written statement. So that exception might not fit.

Another point: the roommate's complaint was in a different lawsuit. Since the roommate settled and dismissed his case against the graduate, could that affect admissibility? I don't think so; the prior inconsistent statement rule doesn't depend on whether the case was dismissed. It's about whether the statement was made under oath and is inconsistent.

Wait, but the roommate is testifying in the rider's trial. The complaint was from a different case, but it's a written statement. So it's a prior inconsistent statement made under oath because it's part of a legal proceeding. Therefore, it should be admissible for impeachment purposes.

Looking at the options, H is "admissible as a prior inconsistent statement." That seems correct. 

Wait, but could it also be hearsay? Because the roommate's statement in the complaint is being offered to prove that the graduate was speeding, which would be the truth of the matter. But in this context, it's being used to impeach the roommate's testimony, not for the truth. So it's not hearsay because it's not being offered for the truth; it's being used to show that the roommate's current testimony is inconsistent and perhaps not credible.

Alternatively, if it's being used to show that the roommate's statement is biased, then maybe it's not hearsay. Wait, noâ€”impeachment with prior inconsistent statements is allowed, and the statement can be used to show the inconsistency, regardless of whether it's hearsay for another purpose. But in this case, the statement is being offered to show that the graduate was speeding, which would be hearsay. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, no. The roommate's testimony was about seeing the rider run a red light. The rider is trying to show that the roommate is lying because in his complaint, he said the graduate was speeding. So the roommate's statement in the complaint is being offered to impeach his current testimony, not to prove that the graduate was speeding. Therefore, it's not hearsay because it's not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that the graduate was speeding), but rather to show that the roommate's current testimony is inconsistent and therefore unreliable.

So, the statement is admissible as a prior inconsistent statement, making option H correct.

The roommate's complaint against the graduate, which alleged the graduate was speeding, is being offered by the rider to rebut the roommate's testimony. The roommate testified about the rider's actions, and the rider is using the complaint to impeach the roommate's credibility by showing inconsistency in his statements. 

The complaint qualifies as a prior inconsistent statement because it was made under oath as part of a legal proceeding. Although the roommate's lawsuit was dismissed, the statement's admissibility depends on its inconsistency with his current testimony, not the outcome of the prior case. The complaint is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted (that the graduate was speeding) but to challenge the roommate's reliability as a witness. Therefore, it is admissible as a prior inconsistent statement.
