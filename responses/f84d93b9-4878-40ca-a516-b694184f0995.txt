Question:

On May 2, a woman mailed the following letter to a man:"May 1I have two tickets to the concert on July 1 at the auditorium in town. I'll sell them to you for $60 per ticket, which is $10 above face value. Since the concert has been sold out for months, I think that is a good deal. You have 15 days from the above date to decide whether to accept this offer. "The man received the letter on May 4, but did not read it until May 6. On May 18, the man went to the woman's home and attempted to accept the offer. The woman replied:"Too late! I sold the tickets last week for $75 each. "Assume that the woman's letter created in the man a valid power of acceptance. Was that power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17?

Options:

A: Yes, because the man did not read the letter until after the 15-day period.
B: No, because the woman sold the tickets before the man could accept the offer.
C: Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.
D: No, because the man attempted to accept the offer within 15 days of receiving the letter.
E: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.
F: No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6.
G: No, because the man was still within the 15-day period when he went to the woman's home.
H: No, because the man received the letter on May 4.
I: Yes, because the woman had already sold the tickets by the time the man went to her home.
J: Yes, because the man attempted to accept the offer after 15 days from the date of the letter.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the man's attempt to accept the offer was too late because the power of acceptance had lapsed. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the woman sent a letter on May 2. The letter says the man has 15 days from the date of the letter (which is May 1) to decide. So, the 15-day period starts on May 1. Let me count that: May 1 is day 1, so adding 15 days would take us to May 16. Wait, no, because 15 days from May 1 would end on May 16, right? Because May 1 + 15 days is May 16. So the offer would expire at the end of May 16.

Next, the man received the letter on May 4. He didn't read it until May 6. So he learned about the offer on the 6th. Now, he goes to the woman's home on May 18 to accept. Hmm, May 18 is after May 16, so that's outside the 15-day window. But wait, the 15 days from May 1 would end on May 16, so May 17 and beyond are after the period.

Wait, but sometimes people count inclusive or exclusive. Let me check: If the period is 15 days from May 1, that's May 1 to May 15, because the first day is included. So, the last day to accept would be May 15. So May 16 would be after the period. Therefore, the man went on May 18, which is definitely after.

But wait, the letter was sent on May 2, and he received it on May 4. Does the time start when he receives it or from the date the letter was sent? In contract law, usually, the offer's validity period starts from the date stated in the offer, unless it's a mistake. So the 15 days are from May 1, making the last day May 15.

So the man received the offer on May 4 but didn't read it until May 6. So he learned about it on May 6. But the offer had already expired on May 15, right? Wait, no, because May 15 is the last day. So May 16 is day 16, which is too late.

Wait, no, May 1 is day 1, so May 15 is the 15th day. So the offer is good until May 15. The man went on May 18, which is definitely after. But wait, he didn't read the letter until May 6, so he only had until May 15 to accept. May 6 to May 15 is 10 days, but the offer's period was 15 days starting from May 1, so May 15 is the last day.

So when he went on May 18, the offer had already expired. Therefore, the power of acceptance had lapsed before he attempted to accept.

Looking at the options:

A: Yes, because he didn't read until after 15 days. But wait, he read it on May 6, which is within the 15 days (since May 1 to May 15 is 15 days). So May 6 is within that period. So the offer wasn't expired when he read it, but when he tried to accept on May 18, which is after.

So the power of acceptance ended on May 15, so when he went on May 18, it was too late. Therefore, the power was terminated by lapse before he attempted to accept.

Looking at the options, option J says: Yes, because the man attempted to accept after 15 days from the date of the letter. The letter was dated May 1, so 15 days would be May 16. So May 18 is after, so J is correct.

Wait, but option A says he didn't read until after 15 days. But he read it on May 6, which is within the 15 days. So A is incorrect. Option J is correct because the 15 days from May 1 ended on May 15, and he accepted on May 18, which is after.

Another option is G: No, because he was still within the period when he went on May 18. Wait, May 18 is after May 15, so G is incorrect. So J is the correct answer.
</think>

The offer was valid for 15 days from May 1, ending on May 15. The man received the letter on May 4 and read it on May 6, but he attempted to accept on May 18, which was after the expiration date. Therefore, the power of acceptance had lapsed before his acceptance.

Answer: J
