Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about a nucleus of mass M that emits a gamma ray of energy E_Υ. The nucleus was initially at rest, and I need to find its recoil energy after the emission.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that when a nucleus emits a gamma ray, it's a photon, which has energy and momentum. Since the nucleus was at rest initially, the total momentum before emission is zero. After emission, the nucleus must recoil in the opposite direction of the photon to conserve momentum. So, the momentum of the photon equals the momentum of the recoiling nucleus.

Wait, but photons don't have mass, right? Their momentum is E/c, where E is their energy and c is the speed of light. So the photon's momentum is E_Υ / c.

Let me denote the nucleus's mass as M, and its recoil velocity as v. The momentum of the nucleus would be gamma times M times v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But wait, the nucleus's mass is much larger than the photon's, so maybe the recoil velocity is non-relativistic. That might simplify things because then gamma is approximately 1, and momentum would be just Mv.

So, setting the photon's momentum equal to the nucleus's momentum: E_Υ / c = Mv. That gives v = E_Υ / (M c).

Now, the kinetic energy of the nucleus is (1/2) M v², assuming it's non-relativistic. Plugging in v, that becomes (1/2) M (E_Υ²) / (M² c²) ) = (E_Υ²) / (2 M c²). Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that exact expression.

Wait, wait, the options have E_Υ squared over terms with M and c squared. Let me check the options again.

Option I is E_Υ squared divided by (2 M c²). Oh, but wait, no, looking at the options, option I is written as E_Υ squared over (2 M c²), but here's the thing: in my calculation, the kinetic energy is E_Υ²/(2 M c²). So that would be option I. But wait, wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, in the problem statement, the options are a bit confusing. Let me list them:

A: E_Υ^2 / (4 M c²)
B: 2 E_Υ^2 / (M c²)
C: E_Υ / (M c²)
D: 3 E_Υ^2 / (2 M c²)
E: E_Υ^2 / (4 M c²)
F: E_Υ / (2 M c²)
G: 4 E_Υ^2 / (M c²)
H: E_Υ^2 / (M c²)
I: E_Υ^2 / (2 M c²)
J: E_Υ^2 / (2 M c^2) ? Wait, option J is written as E_Υ²/(2 M c²) but without any denominator factors. Wait, J is written as E_Υ squared over (2 M). Hmm, no, the problem statement might have a typo, but looking back, the user wrote:

Option J: E_Υ² / (2 M )

Wait, but that's without the c squared, which doesn't make sense because energy has units of mass times c squared. So perhaps J is E_Υ squared over (2 M c squared), but maybe the user made a mistake in formatting. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed carefully.

Wait, my calculation gave (E_Υ²)/(2 M c²), which matches option I. So I think the answer is option I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when the nucleus emits a photon, the energy of the nucleus includes its rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But in this case, since it's initially at rest, the recoil energy is just the kinetic energy. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach it using conservation of energy and momentum more formally, without assuming non-relativistic speeds.

Let me try that. Let me denote the energy of the photon as E_Υ. The nucleus's initial energy is just its rest energy, M c².

After emission, the nucleus has energy E' and momentum p. The photon has energy E_Υ and momentum p_γ = E_Υ / c.

Conservation of energy: M c² = E' + E_Υ.

Conservation of momentum: 0 = p - p_γ → p = p_γ = E_Υ / c.

The nucleus's energy E' is given by the relativistic energy formula: E' = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (M c²)^2 ).

Substituting p = E_Υ / c, we get E' = sqrt( (E_Υ^2) + (M^2 c^4) ).

So the kinetic energy of the nucleus is E' - M c² = sqrt(E_Υ^2 + M² c^4) - M c².

Hmm, this is more accurate, but it's a bit complicated. Let me see if I can expand this using a binomial approximation if E_Υ is much smaller than M c², which is usually the case for heavy nuclei.

So, sqrt(E_Υ^2 + M² c^4) = M c² sqrt(1 + (E_Υ^2)/(M² c^4)) ≈ M c² [1 + (1/2)(E_Υ^2)/(M² c^4)].

So E' ≈ M c² + (E_Υ^2)/(2 M c²).

Then, kinetic energy K = E' - M c² ≈ (E_Υ^2)/(2 M c²), which matches what I got earlier under the non-relativistic assumption.

Therefore, the recoil energy is E_Υ squared divided by (2 M c squared), which is option I.
</think>

The recoil energy of the nucleus after emitting a gamma ray is calculated using conservation of momentum and energy. Assuming the nucleus is initially at rest, the photon's momentum equals the nucleus's recoil momentum. The photon's momentum is \( E_\Upsilon / c \), and the nucleus's momentum is \( Mv \), leading to \( v = E_\Upsilon / (M c) \). The kinetic energy of the nucleus is then \( (1/2) M v^2 = E_\Upsilon^2 / (2 M c^2) \). This matches option I.
