Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Part (a) asks for the value of an inductor that carries 2 A of current and stores 20 J of energy. I remember that the energy stored in an inductor is given by the formula:

E = (1/2) * L * I²

Where E is energy, L is inductance, and I is current. I need to solve for L. So I'll rearrange the formula to get L by itself.

L = (2E) / I²

Plugging in the numbers, E is 20 J and I is 2 A. So:

L = (2 * 20) / (2²) = 40 / 4 = 10 H. Wait, but looking at the options, 10 H is option G's inductor value. But wait, let me double-check that. Did I do the math right? 2 times 20 is 40, and 2 squared is 4. 40 divided by 4 is indeed 10, so L should be 10 H. Hmm, but let me check the options again. Option G is 10 H, 160 μF. So the inductor part is 10 H, which matches. But I also have part (b) to solve.

Part (b) is about a capacitor with 500 V across it, storing 20 J of energy. The formula for energy stored in a capacitor is:

E = (1/2) * C * V²

Again, I need to solve for C. Rearranging, I get:

C = (2E) / V²

Plugging in E=20 J and V=500 V:

C = (2 * 20) / (500)^2 = 40 / 250,000 = 0.00016 F. Converting that to microfarads (since 1 F = 1,000,000 μF), I multiply by 1e6:

0.00016 F * 1e6 μF/F = 160 μF. 

So the capacitor should be 160 μF. Now I look at the options. Which option has L=10 H and C=160 μF? That's option G: 10 H, 160 μF. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the inductor, using 2 A and 20 J, 10 H seems right. For the capacitor, 500 V and 20 J, so 40 divided by 250,000 is 0.00016 F, which is 160 μF. Yep, that's correct. So the correct answer should be option G.

The correct answer is G: 10 H, 160 μF.
