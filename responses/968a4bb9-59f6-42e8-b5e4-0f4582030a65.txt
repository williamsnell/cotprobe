Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what Augustine's stance is on Academic skepticism. I remember that Augustine was a philosopher and theologian, so his views probably blend both areas. I think he wrote about various philosophical topics, including skepticism.

Academic skepticism refers to the philosophical school that doubts the possibility of knowledge, right? They argue that we can't know anything for certain. So, Augustine must have had some response to that.

I recall that Augustine was influenced by Platonism and Christian thought. He probably believed in the possibility of true knowledge, especially since he talks about God and the soul. So, maybe he didn't agree with the skeptical view that nothing can be known.

Looking at the options, I need to see which one aligns with Augustine's position. Let's go through them:

A: Neither true nor false, cannot be proven. That sounds like a middle ground, but Augustine likely had a clear stance.

B: Neither true nor false, but can be refuted. Maybe, but I'm not sure if he thought it could be proven.

C: False and can be refuted. If Augustine argues that skepticism is wrong, this could fit.

D: False but cannot be refuted. That seems contradictory because if it's false, you should be able to refute it.

E: True and can be proven. Unlikely, since skepticism says you can't know, so Augustine probably didn't think it's true.

F: True but can be refuted. Doesn't make sense if it's true.

G: False and can be proven. So, Augustine would argue against it successfully.

H: True but can be refuted. Doesn't fit because if it's true, why refute it?

I: False and cannot be proven. Hmm, but Augustine would likely have arguments against it, so maybe it can be proven.

J: True but cannot be proven. Doesn't fit with Augustine's belief in certain knowledge.

So, from this, options C and G are about skepticism being false. The difference is whether it can be refuted. Augustine, as a Christian philosopher, probably did attempt to refute skepticism by asserting that certain truths, like those of faith and reason, are knowable. Therefore, he might have thought Academic skepticism is false and can be refuted. That points to option C.
