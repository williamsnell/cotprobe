Okay, let's tackle this boat crossing problem. So, the boatman wants to go across a canal that's 3 km wide, and he needs to land 2 km upstream from where he started. The current is flowing at 3.5 km/h, and his boat's speed is 13 km/h. I need to figure out how long the trip will take.

Hmm, first, I remember that when dealing with currents, the boat's effective speed relative to the ground is affected by the current. So, the boat's speed relative to the water is 13 km/h, but the water itself is moving downstream at 3.5 km/h. So, the boatman has to aim upstream to counteract the current so that he ends up 2 km upstream.

Wait, no, wait. If he wants to land 2 km upstream, that means the current is trying to push him downstream, so he needs to point his boat upstream to compensate. But actually, the problem says he wants to land 2 km upstream from his starting point. So, maybe the current is going downstream, and he's trying to go upstream relative to the water, but the net effect is he ends up 2 km upstream from where he started on the bank.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me visualize it. The canal is flowing from, say, north to south (downstream). The boatman starts on the west bank and wants to land 2 km upstream on the east bank, which would be north of his starting point. Wait, no, maybe the canal is flowing east, and the starting point is on the west bank, and he wants to land 2 km upstream (north) from where he started. Hmm, maybe the direction isn't as important as the vector components.

I think the key here is to figure out the boat's velocity relative to the ground. Let's break it down into components. The boat's speed relative to the water is 13 km/h. Let's denote the boat's velocity relative to the water as vector B, and the water's velocity relative to the ground as vector C. So, the boatman's velocity relative to the ground is B + C.

Wait, no, actually, the boat's velocity relative to the water is vector B, and the water's velocity relative to the ground is vector C. So, the boat's velocity relative to the ground is B + C. But in this case, the current is downstream, so vector C is in the downstream direction. The boatman wants his resultant velocity to be such that after crossing, he's 2 km upstream from his starting point.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a vector problem. The boatman needs to end up 2 km upstream, but the current is pushing downstream. So, the resultant displacement needs to be 3 km across the canal and 2 km upstream. So, the resultant displacement vector is 3 km in the across direction (let's say y-axis) and 2 km in the upstream (let's say negative x-axis) direction.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the canal is 3 km wide. So, the width is the distance across the canal, which I'll consider as the y-axis. The starting point is on one bank, and the landing point is 2 km upstream from that starting point on the opposite bank. So, the displacement vector from start to end is 3 km across (y) and 2 km upstream (x direction opposite to the current).

But the current is flowing downstream, so in the x direction. So, the boat's velocity relative to water (B) has to have components such that when combined with the current's velocity (C), the resultant displacement after time t is ( -2 km, 3 km ). Wait, negative because upstream is opposite to the current.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of relative velocity. The boatman's velocity relative to the water is 13 km/h, and the water is moving at 3.5 km/h downstream. So, the boatman's velocity relative to the ground is the vector sum of his velocity relative to the water and the water's velocity relative to the ground.

But the boatman wants to end up 2 km upstream, which is against the current. So, the resultant displacement in the x direction (along the canal) should be -2 km (upstream), and the displacement in the y direction should be 3 km (across the canal).

Wait, but how does that work? Because if the current is pushing downstream, the boatman has to point upstream enough so that the net displacement is upstream by 2 km.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this using vectors. Let me denote the boat's velocity relative to water as (vx, vy), where vx is the component along the canal (x-axis) and vy is across (y-axis). The water's velocity is (3.5, 0) km/h downstream, so relative to ground, the boat's velocity is (vx + 3.5, vy).

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the boat's velocity relative to water is (vx, vy), and the water's velocity relative to ground is (3.5, 0). So, the boat's velocity relative to ground is (vx + 3.5, vy). Wait, no, that would be if the boat is moving in the same direction as the water. Wait, no, actually, the boat's velocity relative to water is (vx, vy), so the water's velocity relative to ground is (3.5, 0). Therefore, the boat's velocity relative to ground is (vx + 3.5, vy). Wait, no, that's not correct because the water's velocity is downstream, so if the boat's velocity relative to water is (vx, vy), then relative to ground, it's (vx + 3.5, vy). But I think this is incorrect because the boat's velocity relative to water is a vector that includes both x and y components. So, perhaps I should model it as the boat's velocity relative to water is (vx, vy), and the water's velocity is (3.5, 0), so the boat's velocity relative to ground is (vx + 3.5, vy).

But the boatman wants his resultant displacement after time t to be (-2, 3) km. So, the displacement is (velocity relative to ground) multiplied by time t.

So, the displacement in the x direction is (vx + 3.5) * t = -2 km.

The displacement in the y direction is vy * t = 3 km.

But the boat's speed relative to water is 13 km/h, so the magnitude of (vx, vy) is 13. So, sqrt(vx^2 + vy^2) = 13.

Now, let's set up the equations.

From y-direction: vy * t = 3 => vy = 3 / t.

From x-direction: (vx + 3.5) * t = -2 => vx = (-2 / t) - 3.5.

Now, substituting into the speed equation:

vx^2 + vy^2 = 13^2.

So, [ (-2/t - 3.5)^2 ] + [ (3/t)^2 ] = 169.

Let me compute each term.

First, let's expand (-2/t - 3.5)^2:

= ( (-2/t) - 3.5 )^2
= ( ( -2 - 3.5 t ) / t )^2
= ( ( -2 - 3.5 t )^2 ) / t^2
= (4 + 14 t + 12.25 t^2) / t^2

Wait, no, let me correct that. Wait, (-2/t - 3.5)^2 = ( ( -2 - 3.5 t ) / t )^2.

Wait, no, more accurately:

Let me compute (-2/t - 3.5)^2:

= ( (-2/t) - 3.5 )^2
= ( (-2/t) )^2 + 2 * (-2/t) * (-3.5) + (-3.5)^2
= (4 / t²) + (14 / t) + 12.25

Similarly, (3/t)^2 = 9 / t².

So, adding these together:

(4/t² + 14/t + 12.25) + (9/t²) = 169.

Combine like terms:

(4 + 9)/t² + 14/t + 12.25 = 169.

13/t² + 14/t + 12.25 = 169.

Subtract 169 from both sides:

13/t² + 14/t + 12.25 - 169 = 0.

13/t² + 14/t - 156.75 = 0.

Multiply both sides by t² to eliminate denominators:

13 + 14 t - 156.75 t² = 0.

Rearranging:

-156.75 t² + 14 t +13 = 0.

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the quadratic coefficient positive:

156.75 t² -14 t -13 = 0.

Now, this is a quadratic equation in the form a t² + b t + c = 0, where a = 156.75, b = -14, c = -13.

Using the quadratic formula:

t = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a).

Compute discriminant D:

D = (-14)^2 - 4 * 156.75 * (-13)
= 196 + 4 * 156.75 * 13.

Compute 4 * 156.75 = 627.

Then 627 * 13: Let's compute 600*13=7800, 27*13=351. So total is 7800 + 351 = 8151.

So D = 196 + 8151 = 8347.

Now sqrt(8347) ≈ let's see, 91^2 = 8281, 92^2=8464. So sqrt(8347) is between 91 and 92. Let's compute 91.5^2 = (91 + 0.5)^2 = 91² + 2*91*0.5 + 0.5² = 8281 + 91 + 0.25 = 8372.25. Hmm, that's higher than 8347. So maybe around 91.35.

But perhaps it's better to approximate sqrt(8347) as about 91.35.

So t = [14 ± 91.35] / (2 * 156.75).

We can ignore the negative solution because time can't be negative.

So t = (14 + 91.35) / (313.5) ≈ 105.35 / 313.5 ≈ 0.336 hours.

Convert hours to minutes: 0.336 * 60 ≈ 20.16 minutes.

Wait, but looking at the options, F is 20.2 min. So that's close.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again because the answer seems a bit high, and maybe I made an error in the quadratic equation setup.

Wait, let me go back. The displacement in the x direction is (vx + 3.5) * t = -2.

Wait, but if the current is downstream, and the boatman wants to land upstream, then (vx + 3.5) must be negative, so that the net displacement is upstream. So, (vx + 3.5) = -2 / t.

Similarly, vy * t = 3.

So, the boat's velocity relative to water is (vx, vy), which is sqrt(vx² + vy²) = 13.

So, substituting vx = (-2/t) - 3.5.

Then, [(-2/t - 3.5)^2 + (3/t)^2] = 13^2.

Let me compute this again.

Expanding (-2/t -3.5)^2 = ( (-2 - 3.5 t)/t )^2 = (4 + 14t + 12.25 t²)/t².

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each term separately.

(-2/t -3.5)^2 = ( (-2/t) )^2 + 2*(-2/t)(-3.5) + (-3.5)^2 = 4/t² + 14/t + 12.25.

Adding (3/t)^2 = 9/t².

So, total is 4/t² + 14/t +12.25 +9/t² = 13/t² +14/t +12.25 =169.

So, 13/t² +14/t +12.25 =169.

Subtract 169: 13/t² +14/t -156.75=0.

Multiply by t²: 13 +14t -156.75 t²=0.

Rearrange: -156.75 t² +14t +13=0.

Multiply by -1:156.75 t² -14t -13=0.

a=156.75, b=-14, c=-13.

Discriminant D= b²-4ac= (-14)^2 -4*(156.75)*(-13)=196 + 4*156.75*13.

Compute 4*156.75=627.

627*13: 600*13=7800, 27*13=351. Total 7800+351=8151.

So D=196 +8151=8347.

sqrt(8347)= approx 91.35.

So t=(14 +91.35)/(2*156.75)=105.35/(313.5)= approx 0.336 hours.

Convert to minutes: 0.336 *60=20.16 minutes, which is about 20.2 minutes. So option F.

But wait, the options have F as 20.2 min, which matches. But wait, let me think again: is the displacement in the x-direction correctly considered?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. The boatman wants to land 2 km upstream, so the displacement in the x-direction is +2 km upstream, not -2 km. Wait, that might change the signs.

Wait, if the current is downstream, then the x-direction positive is downstream. So, the boatman's displacement is 2 km upstream, which would be negative in x. So, (vx + 3.5) * t = -2 km.

Yes, that's correct. So the setup is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Since the boat's speed relative to water is 13 km/h, and the current is 3.5 km/h, the effective speed upstream is 13 - 3.5 = 9.5 km/h. Wait, no, that's not correct because the boat's upstream component has to be more than the current to actually go upstream.

Wait, no, the effective speed in the x-direction (upstream) would be (boat's x-component velocity) + current's velocity. Wait, no, the current is downstream, so the boat's x-component relative to water is (vx), and the water's x-component is 3.5 km/h downstream, which is positive x. So, the boat's velocity relative to ground in x is (vx + 3.5). But since the boatman wants to end up upstream, (vx + 3.5) must be negative, so that the net displacement is upstream.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the boatman needs to aim upstream such that his resultant velocity in the x-direction is upstream. So, perhaps the boat's velocity relative to water has a component upstream that counteracts the current and results in a net upstream displacement.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the time it takes to cross the canal, considering the x and y components.

Wait, the time to cross the canal is determined by the y-component of the velocity. Because the width is 3 km, and the y-component of the boat's velocity relative to ground is vy.

Wait, but vy is the y-component of the boat's velocity relative to the water, which is independent of the current because the current only affects the x-component.

Wait, no, the boat's velocity relative to water has both x and y components. So, the boat's velocity relative to ground is (vx + 3.5, vy).

So, the time to cross is determined by how long it takes for the y-component to cover 3 km. So, vy * t =3 km.

But vy is part of the boat's velocity relative to water, which is 13 km/h. So, vy = 13 * sin(theta), where theta is the angle upstream that the boatman points.

Similarly, the x-component of the boat's velocity relative to water is 13 * cos(theta). But since the current is downstream, the net x-velocity relative to ground is (13 cos(theta) + 3.5). To have a net upstream displacement, this must be negative, so 13 cos(theta) +3.5 <0, which implies cos(theta) < -3.5/13 ≈ -0.269, so theta > 104 degrees. That seems possible.

The displacement in the x-direction is (13 cos(theta) +3.5) * t = 2 km upstream (so positive 2 km if upstream is considered positive in x). Wait, no, if upstream is positive x, then the displacement would be +2 km. But the current is downstream, so the net velocity in x is (13 cos(theta) +3.5). To have a positive displacement upstream, (13 cos(theta) +3.5) must be positive. Wait, that contradicts earlier. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the sign convention.

Let me redefine the coordinate system: let’s take downstream as positive x. So, the current is +3.5 km/h in x. The boatman wants to land 2 km upstream, which is -2 km in x.

So, the displacement in x is (vx +3.5)*t = -2.

And in y, vy * t =3.

So, the boat's velocity relative to water is (vx, vy), with sqrt(vx² + vy²)=13.

So, from x: (vx +3.5) * t = -2 => vx = (-2/t) -3.5.

From y: vy = 3/t.

Substitute into speed equation:

[ (-2/t -3.5)^2 + (3/t)^2 ] =13^2.

Expanding:

(4/t² +14/t +12.25) +9/t² =169.

So, (13/t²) +14/t +12.25 =169.

Subtract 169: 13/t² +14/t -156.75=0.

Multiply by t²:13 +14t -156.75 t²=0.

Rearranged:156.75 t² -14t -13=0.

Quadratic formula: t=(14 + sqrt(14^2 +4*156.75*13))/(2*156.75).

Compute discriminant D=196 +4*156.75*13=196+8151=8347.

sqrt(8347)=~91.35.

t=(14 +91.35)/(313.5)=105.35/313.5≈0.336 hours≈20.16 min≈20.2 min. So, the answer is F:20.2 min.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the boat's motion relative to the ground, considering both its velocity relative to the water and the water's velocity due to the current. The boatman aims to land 2 km upstream from his starting point while crossing a 3 km wide canal. The boat's speed relative to the water is 13 km/h, and the current flows downstream at 3.5 km/h.

### Step 1: Define the velocity components
Let the boat's velocity relative to the water be \( \vec{B} = (v_x, v_y) \), where \( v_x \) is the component along the canal (x-axis) and \( v_y \) is across the canal (y-axis). The water's velocity relative to the ground is \( \vec{C} = (3.5, 0) \) km/h downstream.

The boat's velocity relative to the ground is:
\[
\vec{V} = \vec{B} + \vec{C} = (v_x + 3.5, v_y)
\]

The boatman wants to land 2 km upstream, so the resultant displacement in the x-direction is \( -2 \) km (upstream), and in the y-direction is \( +3 \) km (across the canal).

### Step 2: Set up the equations of motion
The displacement in the x-direction:
\[
(v_x + 3.5) \cdot t = -2
\]

The displacement in the y-direction:
\[
v_y \cdot t = 3
\]

The boat's speed relative to the water is 13 km/h:
\[
\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = 13
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( v_x \) and \( v_y \)
From the y-direction equation:
\[
v_y = \frac{3}{t}
\]

From the x-direction equation:
\[
v_x = \frac{-2}{t} - 3.5
\]

Substitute \( v_x \) and \( v_y \) into the speed equation:
\[
\left( \frac{-2}{t} - 3.5 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{3}{t} \right)^2 = 13^2
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
\frac{4}{t^2} + \frac{14}{t} + 12.25 + \frac{9}{t^2} = 169
\]
\[
\frac{13}{t^2} + \frac{14}{t} + 12.25 = 169
\]
\[
\frac{13}{t^2} + \frac{14}{t} - 156.75 = 0
\]

Multiply through by \( t^2 \):
\[
13 + 14t - 156.75t^2 = 0
\]

Rearrange:
\[
156.75t^2 - 14t - 13 = 0
\]

### Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation
Using the quadratic formula:
\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
where \( a = 156.75 \), \( b = -14 \), and \( c = -13 \).

Compute the discriminant:
\[
D = (-14)^2 - 4(156.75)(-13) = 196 + 8151 = 8347
\]
\[
\sqrt{8347} \approx 91.35
\]

Substitute into the formula:
\[
t = \frac{14 + 91.35}{2(156.75)} = \frac{105.35}{313.5} \approx 0.336 \, \text{hours}
\]

Convert to minutes:
\[
t \approx 0.336 \times 60 \approx 20.16 \, \text{minutes}
\]

### Final Answer:
The trip will take approximately **20.2 minutes**.
