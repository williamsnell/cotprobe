C: Bb Bb
D: Bb bb
E: BB Bb
F: bb Bb
G: BB BB
H: Bb Bb Bb
I: BB bb

Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about minks and their fur color. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that the gene for brown fur (B) is dominant over silver (b). So, that means any B allele will express brown fur, and only when both alleles are b will the fur be silver. Got it. 

The question is asking which cross (set of genotypes) could produce offspring with silver fur. Both parents have brown fur, so they must each carry at least one B allele, right? Because if you have brown fur, your genotype can't be bb. So the parents can't be bb, they have to be either BB or Bb.

Looking at the options, I need to find a pair where both parents have brown fur but their combination can produce a silver offspring. Silver is recessive, so the only way for the offspring to have silver fur is if they get a b from each parent. That means each parent must carry at least one b allele. So both parents can't be BB because BB can't pass on a b. They have to be Bb because they have one B and one b each.

Let me check the options. Option C is Bb Bb. Both parents are Bb, which means each can give a B or a b. The possible combinations for their offspring would be BB (brown), Bb (brown), Bb (brown), and bb (silver). So yes, there's a 25% chance of getting silver. That's a possible option.

Option D is Bb and bb. Wait, but the question says both parents have brown fur. If one parent is bb, that's silver fur, which isn't allowed. So D is out because one parent isn't brown.

Option F is bb and Bb. Again, same issue as D. One parent is silver, so that's not possible because the question states both parents are brown.

Option I is BB and bb. Again, one parent is bb (silver), which doesn't fit. So I can eliminate that.

Looking at other options: A is bb and bb, but both are silver, so they can't have brown. So A is wrong. B is Bb and BB, so the parents are Bb and BB, both brown. Let's see their possible offspring. The Bb parent can give B or b, and the BB parent can only give B. So possible genotypes are BB (brown) and Bb (brown). No bb, so no silver. So B gives no silver.

Option E is BB and Bb. Both are brown. The BB can only give B, and the Bb can give B or b. So the offspring can be BB or Bb. No bb, so no silver. So E doesn't work.

Option G is BB and BB. Both are homozygous dominant. They can only produce BB offspring, so all brown. So G is out.

Option H is Bb Bb Bb. Hmm, that's a bit odd. I think each parent is Bb, but the way it's written is a bit confusing. Wait, no, each parent's genotype is Bb, so same as option C. So that would work, but I don't think that's an option here because H is written as Bb Bb Bb, which might be a typo or misunderstanding. Wait, no, looking back, option H is written as one genotype, like a single parent? No, the options are pairs. So probably H is not a valid cross.

Wait, looking back at the options, I think each option is two parents. So option H is written as Bb Bb Bb, but that's three Bb's. That doesn't make sense for a cross. Maybe a typo, but I think it's intended to be a single parent with a genotype of Bb Bb Bb, which isn't possible in diploid organisms. So H is probably not a valid option.

So the only possible cross where both parents are brown and can produce a silver offspring is option C: Bb and Bb. Because each can pass on a b allele, giving a 25% chance of bb (silver).

The correct answer is C: Bb and Bb. Both parents are heterozygous for brown fur, meaning they carry one dominant (B) and one recessive (b) allele. When crossed, there is a 25% chance of producing an offspring with the genotype bb, which results in silver fur due to the recessive trait being expressed. All other options either involve at least one parent with silver fur (disallowed by the question) or do not produce the necessary bb genotype in the offspring.

Answer: C
