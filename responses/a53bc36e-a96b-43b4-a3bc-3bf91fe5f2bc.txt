<think>
Okay, so I have this question about the equilibrium composition of a mixture involving carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and molecular oxygen. The conditions given are 3000°K and 30 psia. The mixture contains 5 atoms of oxygen per atom of carbon. I need to find the correct equilibrium composition from the given options A to J.

First, I should probably start by understanding the problem. The mixture consists of CO, CO2, and O2. The ratio of oxygen atoms to carbon atoms is 5:1. That means for every 1 carbon atom, there are 5 oxygen atoms. Since CO has one O per CO molecule, CO2 has two O per molecule, and O2 has two O per molecule, I need to figure out how these contribute to the total O atoms.

Wait, maybe I should write down the given information more clearly. The ratio is 5 O atoms per C atom. So, if I let the number of C atoms be N, then O atoms would be 5N. Now, the molecules present are CO, CO2, and O2. Let's think about each molecule's contribution to O atoms.

Each CO molecule contributes 1 O atom. Each CO2 contributes 2 O atoms. Each O2 molecule contributes 2 O atoms. So, the total number of O atoms from all three would be the sum of O from CO, CO2, and O2.

Let me denote the number of moles (or molecules, since we're dealing with ratios) of CO, CO2, and O2 as n_CO, n_CO2, and n_O2 respectively.

So, the total O atoms would be:
Total O = (1 * n_CO) + (2 * n_CO2) + (2 * n_O2)

But wait, the total O atoms are 5N, and the total C atoms are N. The C comes from CO and CO2 only. So, the total C atoms are:
Total C = n_CO + n_CO2

Given that the ratio is 5 O per C, so:
Total O = 5 * Total C
=> (n_CO) + 2(n_CO2) + 2(n_O2) = 5 [n_CO + n_CO2]

Let me write that equation again:
n_CO + 2n_CO2 + 2n_O2 = 5(n_CO + n_CO2)

Simplify the right side:
5n_CO +5n_CO2

So, moving everything to one side:
n_CO +2n_CO2 +2n_O2 -5n_CO -5n_CO2 =0
=> (-4n_CO) -3n_CO2 +2n_O2 =0
=> 2n_O2 =4n_CO +3n_CO2
=> n_O2 = (4n_CO +3n_CO2)/2

Hmm, that's one equation, but I have three variables. I'll need another equation based on the reaction or maybe using the ideal gas law and partial pressures.

Wait, the problem is about equilibrium, so perhaps it involves a chemical reaction. Which reaction? Maybe the formation of CO and CO2 from C and O2? Or perhaps the dissociation of CO2 into CO and O2? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's a mixture where these gases are in equilibrium due to some reaction.

Wait, perhaps the relevant reaction is the formation of CO and CO2 from C and O2. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's the formation of CO2 from CO and O2. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving C, O2, CO, and CO2. Let me consider the possible reactions.

Wait, another approach: since the problem gives the ratio of O to C atoms as 5:1, perhaps I should consider the total moles of each component and relate them using that ratio.

Let me denote the total moles of the mixture as n_total = n_CO + n_CO2 + n_O2.

But the total number of O atoms is 5 times the number of C atoms. The C atoms come from CO and CO2, so:
Total C = n_CO + n_CO2
Total O = n_CO*(1) + n_CO2*(2) + n_O2*(2) =5*(n_CO + n_CO2)

So, the equation I had before is correct.

Now, I need another relation. Perhaps the reaction equation that connects these species. Let me think. Maybe the reaction is the combustion of carbon, but that might produce CO2 and O2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the decomposition of CO2 into CO and O2.

Wait, maybe the reaction is:
2 CO(g) + O2(g) ↔ 2 CO2(g)

But I'm not sure if that's the right reaction to consider. Alternatively, perhaps it's the dissociation of CO2 into CO and O:

CO2 ↔ CO + O

But O is atomic oxygen, which is different from O2. Hmm, but in the problem, the oxygen is in O2 molecules, so perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is the formation of CO and CO2 from C and O2. Let's write that as:

R1: C(s) + O2(g) ↔ 2 CO(g) (unstable, but possible)
R2: C(s) + 2 O2(g) ↔ CO2(g)

But in this case, the presence of C(s) as a solid might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the reactions are at equilibrium involving CO, CO2, and O2.

Wait, perhaps the relevant reaction is the equilibrium between CO, CO2, and O2, which could involve the reaction:

CO2(g) ↔ CO(g) + O(g)

But O is atomic oxygen, not O2. Alternatively, perhaps:

2 CO2(g) ↔ 2 CO(g) + O2(g)

That seems more plausible. Let me write that down:

2 CO2 ↔ 2 CO + O2

The equilibrium constant K for this reaction would depend on the temperature. Since the temperature is 3000 K, which is quite high, I suppose the reaction might favor products, but I'm not sure. Also, I might need the value of K at 3000 K, but I don't have that information.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

CO2 ↔ CO + O

But again, O is an atom, not O2. So perhaps I should write it as:

CO2 ↔ CO + O

But then O would form O2, so maybe:

2 CO2 ↔ 2 CO + O2

That's a better reaction because O2 is a molecule. So, the reaction is:

2 CO2 ↔ 2 CO + O2

The equilibrium expression for this reaction would be:

K = (P_CO^2 * P_O2) / (P_CO2^2)

But I don't know the value of K at 3000 K. Hmm, maybe I can estimate it, but without data, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the mole fractions using the given O to C ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the mole fractions in terms of variables and then use the given ratio to solve.

Let me denote the mole fractions as x_CO, x_CO2, x_O2. So, x_CO + x_CO2 + x_O2 = 1.

Wait, but the problem gives the ratio of O atoms to C atoms as 5:1. So, let's express the total O atoms and total C atoms in terms of mole fractions and partial pressures.

Wait, in a gas mixture, the mole fraction is proportional to the partial pressure. So, the partial pressure of each gas is x_i * P_total, where P_total is 30 psia. But since we're dealing with ratios, maybe I can work with mole fractions directly.

The total number of O atoms is 5 times the total number of C atoms. The C atoms come from CO and CO2. So, for each molecule of CO, there's 1 C atom, and each CO2 has 1 C atom. So, the total C atoms are (n_CO + n_CO2).

Each CO contributes 1 O, each CO2 contributes 2 O atoms, and each O2 contributes 2 O atoms (since it's O2, each molecule has 2 O atoms). So, the total O atoms are:

Total O = n_CO*(1) + n_CO2*(2) + n_O2*(2)

And Total C = n_CO + n_CO2

Given that Total O = 5 * Total C, so:

n_CO + 2n_CO2 + 2n_O2 = 5(n_CO + n_CO2)

Which simplifies to:

n_CO + 2n_CO2 + 2n_O2 =5n_CO +5n_CO2
=> 0 =4n_CO +3n_CO2 -2n_O2
=> 2n_O2 =4n_CO +3n_CO2
=> n_O2 = (4n_CO +3n_CO2)/2

Now, I also know that the sum of the moles is:

n_CO + n_CO2 + n_O2 = n_total

But I don't know n_total. However, since we're dealing with mole fractions, maybe I can express everything in terms of mole fractions.

Let me denote x_CO = n_CO / n_total, x_CO2 = n_CO2 / n_total, x_O2 = n_O2 / n_total.

Then, n_CO = x_CO * n_total, similarly for others.

Substituting into the earlier equation:

n_O2 = (4n_CO +3n_CO2)/2
=> x_O2 * n_total = [4(x_CO n_total) +3(x_CO2 n_total)] / 2
Dividing both sides by n_total (assuming n_total ≠0),
x_O2 = (4x_CO +3x_CO2)/2

Also, the sum of mole fractions is 1:

x_CO + x_CO2 + x_O2 =1

Substituting x_O2 from above,

x_CO + x_CO2 + (4x_CO +3x_CO2)/2 =1

Multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate denominator:

2x_CO + 2x_CO2 +4x_CO +3x_CO2 = 2
(2x_CO +4x_CO) + (2x_CO2 +3x_CO2) =2
6x_CO +5x_CO2 =2

So, equation (1): 6x_CO +5x_CO2 =2

Now, I have another equation from the mole fractions sum.

But I also need another equation, which would come from the reaction's equilibrium expression. Let's assume the reaction is 2 CO2 ↔ 2 CO + O2. Then, the equilibrium constant Kp is:

Kp = (P_CO^2 * P_O2) / (P_CO2^2)

In terms of mole fractions, since P_total is the same for all, the partial pressures are proportional to mole fractions. So,

P_CO = x_CO * P_total
P_CO2 = x_CO2 * P_total
P_O2 = x_O2 * P_total

So,

Kp = [ (x_CO * P_total)^2 * (x_O2 * P_total) ] / (x_CO2 * P_total)^2 )
= [x_CO^2 * x_O2 * P_total^3 ] / (x_CO2^2 * P_total^2)
= (x_CO^2 * x_O2 / x_CO2^2) * P_total

But I don't know Kp at 3000 K. Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing K, I can't proceed. Maybe I can make an assumption based on typical values or perhaps the problem expects me to proceed without K, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different. Maybe it's the dissociation of CO into C and O, but that might not involve CO2. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of CO and CO2 from C and O2, but that would involve the solid carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the problem differently. Since the problem states that the mixture contains 5 atoms of oxygen per atom of carbon, perhaps the initial reaction is the complete combustion of carbon to CO2, but the presence of CO suggests some equilibrium.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

C(s) + O2(g) ↔ 2 CO(g)

But that's not typical; usually, carbon burns to CO2. Alternatively, perhaps it's the reaction:

C(s) + 2 O2(g) ↔ CO2(g)

In that case, the equilibrium would depend on the partial pressure of O2. But without knowing the value of K, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I can make an assumption based on the given options. Let me look at the options and see if any of them fit the equation I derived earlier.

From earlier, I have:

6x_CO +5x_CO2 =2

And x_O2 = (4x_CO +3x_CO2)/2

And x_CO +x_CO2 +x_O2 =1

So, let me try plugging in the options to see which one satisfies these conditions.

Let's take option D: x_CO=0.0891, x_CO2=0.296, x_O2=0.615

Check sum: 0.0891 +0.296 +0.615 =1.0 (approx)

Now, check equation (1): 6x_CO +5x_CO2 =6*0.0891 +5*0.296= 0.5346 +1.48=1.9926 ≈2. So that's close.

Now, check x_O2 = (4x_CO +3x_CO2)/2 = (4*0.0891 +3*0.296)/2 = (0.3564 +0.888)/2 = (1.2444)/2=0.6222. But the given x_O2 is 0.615. Hmm, that's a bit off. Maybe rounding differences.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate x_O2 for option D.

x_CO=0.0891, x_CO2=0.296.

4x_CO =4*0.0891=0.3564

3x_CO2=3*0.296=0.888

Sum: 0.3564 +0.888=1.2444

Divide by 2: 1.2444/2=0.6222

But the given x_O2 in option D is 0.615, which is a bit lower. Hmm, discrepancy. So perhaps option D isn't correct.

Wait, maybe I should check another option. Let's try option C: x_CO=0.087, x_CO2=0.293, x_O2=0.62.

Sum:0.087 +0.293 +0.62=1.0.

Check equation (1):6*0.087=0.522, 5*0.293=1.465, sum=0.522+1.465=1.987≈2, close enough.

Now x_O2 from the formula: (4*0.087 +3*0.293)/2= (0.348 +0.879)/2=1.227/2=0.6135. The given x_O2 is 0.62, which is a bit higher. Hmm, discrepancy again.

Wait, perhaps the options are approximated, so minor discrepancies might be acceptable. Alternatively, maybe I should look for the option where 6x_CO +5x_CO2 is as close to 2 as possible.

Let me check option D again: 6*(0.0891)=0.5346, 5*(0.296)=1.48 → sum=1.9946≈2, which is very close.

x_O2 from the formula would be (4*0.0891 +3*0.296)/2= (0.3564 +0.888)/2=1.2444/2=0.6222. But the given x_O2 is 0.615. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate 4*0.0891: 0.0891 *4=0.3564.

3*0.296=0.888.

Sum:0.3564 +0.888=1.2444.

Divide by 2: 1.2444/2=0.6222.

But in option D, x_O2 is 0.615, which is 0.0072 less than 0.6222. That's a small difference, perhaps due to rounding.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction I assumed isn't the correct one, leading to a different equilibrium expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the dissociation of CO2 into CO and O, but since O2 is present, maybe the reaction is 2 CO2 ↔ 2 CO + O2.

In that case, the Kp would be (P_CO^2 * P_O2) / (P_CO2^2).

But without knowing Kp, I can't proceed numerically. However, perhaps I can use the given mole fractions to calculate Kp and see which option fits.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given O:C ratio to find the mole fractions without considering the reaction, but that seems unlikely because it's about equilibrium.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler: given the O:C ratio, and knowing that the mixture consists of CO, CO2, and O2, find the mole fractions that satisfy the O:C ratio.

In that case, perhaps I don't need to consider the reaction and can solve using just the O:C ratio.

Earlier, I derived that 6x_CO +5x_CO2 =2, and x_O2 = (4x_CO +3x_CO2)/2.

Looking at the options, I can check which ones satisfy these equations.

Let me try option D again.

x_CO=0.0891, x_CO2=0.296.

6x_CO=0.5346, 5x_CO2=1.48, sum=1.9946≈2.

x_O2=(4*0.0891 +3*0.296)/2= (0.3564 +0.888)/2=1.2444/2=0.6222. But the option says 0.615. Close but not exact.

Option C: x_CO=0.087, x_CO2=0.293.

6x_CO=0.522, 5x_CO2=1.465, sum=1.987≈2.

x_O2=(4*0.087 +3*0.293)/2= (0.348 +0.879)/2=1.227/2=0.6135. But option C has x_O2=0.62, which is 0.0065 higher.

Option I: x_CO=0.082, x_CO2=0.287.

6x_CO=0.492, 5x_CO2=1.435, sum=1.927, which is less than 2. So, it doesn't satisfy the equation.

Option H: x_CO=0.091, x_CO2=0.29.

6x_CO=0.546, 5x_CO2=1.45, sum=1.996≈2.

x_O2=(4*0.091 +3*0.29)/2= (0.364 +0.87)/2=1.234/2=0.617. Given x_O2=0.61, which is a bit lower. So discrepancy.

Option E: x_CO=0.075, x_CO2=0.25.

6x_CO=0.45, 5x_CO2=1.25, sum=1.70 <2. Doesn't satisfy.

Option B: x_CO=0.081, x_CO2=0.26.

6x_CO=0.486,5x_CO2=1.3, sum=1.786 <2. Doesn't satisfy.

Option F: x_CO=0.093, x_CO2=0.317.

6x_CO=0.558,5x_CO2=1.585, sum=2.143>2. Doesn't satisfy.

Option G: x_CO=0.095, x_CO2=0.3.

6x_CO=0.57,5x_CO2=1.5, sum=2.07≈2.

x_O2=(4*0.095 +3*0.3)/2= (0.38 +0.9)/2=1.28/2=0.64. But option G has x_O2=0.605. Doesn't match.

Option J: x_CO=0.085, x_CO2=0.335.

6x_CO=0.51,5x_CO2=1.675, sum=2.185>2.

x_O2=(4*0.085 +3*0.335)/2= (0.34 +1.005)/2=1.345/2=0.6725. But option J has x_O2=0.58, which is lower.

Option A: x_CO=0.099, x_CO2=0.3.

6x_CO=0.594,5x_CO2=1.5, sum=2.094≈2.

x_O2=(4*0.099 +3*0.3)/2= (0.396 +0.9)/2=1.296/2=0.648. But option A has x_O2=0.6, which is lower.

So, looking at all options, option D has the sum of 6x_CO +5x_CO2 closest to 2, and x_O2 calculated from the formula is very close to the given value, considering possible rounding errors.

Therefore, the correct answer is likely option D.
</think>

The equilibrium composition of the mixture is determined by the given ratio of oxygen to carbon atoms (5:1) and the relationships derived from the mole fractions. By analyzing the options, option D satisfies the conditions with the closest approximation to the derived equations.
