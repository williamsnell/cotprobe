Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, I need to solve for x in the equation:

√x / (x√3 + √2) = 1 / (2x√6 + 4)

Hmm, let's see. First, maybe I can cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions. That usually helps in these cases. So, cross-multiplying gives:

√x * (2x√6 + 4) = 1 * (x√3 + √2)

Let me write that out:

√x * (2x√6 + 4) = x√3 + √2

Now, I can distribute the √x on the left side:

√x * 2x√6 + √x * 4 = x√3 + √2

Let me simplify each term. Let's take the first term: √x * 2x√6. I can write √x as x^(1/2), so when I multiply by x, which is x^(1), it becomes x^(3/2). So, 2x√6 * x^(1/2) = 2x^(3/2)√6.

Wait, but actually, √x * x is x^(1/2) * x^1 = x^(3/2), which is x√x. So, maybe it's better to think of it as 2x√6 * √x, which is 2x√(6x). Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots. But before that, let's see if we can rearrange the equation.

Let me write the equation again:

2x√6 * √x + 4√x = x√3 + √2

Hmm, maybe I can collect like terms. Let's bring everything to one side:

2x√6 * √x + 4√x - x√3 - √2 = 0

But this looks complicated. Maybe instead, I can let t = √x, so that x = t². Then, substituting, the equation becomes:

t / (t²√3 + √2) = 1 / (2t²√6 + 4)

Wait, let me check that substitution. If x = t², then √x = t. So the left side denominator becomes x√3 + √2 = t²√3 + √2. The right side denominator is 2x√6 +4 = 2t²√6 +4.

So the equation is:

t / (t²√3 + √2) = 1 / (2t²√6 +4)

Now, cross-multiplying again:

t * (2t²√6 +4) = 1 * (t²√3 + √2)

Expanding the left side:

2t³√6 +4t = t²√3 + √2

Hmm, this seems a bit messy, but maybe I can rearrange terms to bring everything to one side:

2t³√6 +4t - t²√3 - √2 = 0

This is a cubic equation in terms of t. Solving a cubic might be challenging, but perhaps there's a rational root or a simple value of t that satisfies this equation.

Let me try plugging in some options. The options for x are given, so t would be sqrt(x). Let's see the options:

A: 1/2 → t = sqrt(1/2) = √(1/2) = (√2)/2 ≈ 0.707
B: 1/4 → t = 1/2
C: 3/4 → t = sqrt(3/4) = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866
D: 1/8 → t = 1/(2√2) ≈ 0.353
E: 2/5 → t = sqrt(2/5) ≈ 0.632
F: 2/3 → t = sqrt(2/3) ≈ 0.816
G: 5/2 → t = sqrt(5/2) ≈ 1.58
H: 1/3 → t ≈ 0.577
I: 3/2 → t = sqrt(3/2) ≈ 1.225
J: 1/16 → t ≈ 0.125

Let me test t = 1/2, which is option B.

Plugging t = 1/2 into the equation:

Left side: 2*(1/2)^3 *√6 +4*(1/2) - (1/2)^2 *√3 - √2

Calculating each term:

2*(1/8)*√6 = (1/4)√6 ≈ 0.612
4*(1/2) = 2
(1/4)*√3 ≈ 0.433
√2 ≈ 1.414

So, putting it all together:

0.612 + 2 - 0.433 - 1.414 ≈ (0.612 + 2) - (0.433 +1.414) ≈ 2.612 - 1.847 ≈ 0.765 ≠ 0

Not zero, so t=1/2 is not a root.

Let me try t=1/√2, which is approximately 0.707, which is option A's t value.

Wait, option A is x=1/2, so t=√(1/2)=1/√2.

Plugging t=1/√2 into the equation:

2*(1/√2)^3 *√6 +4*(1/√2) - (1/√2)^2 *√3 - √2

Calculate each term:

(1/√2)^3 = (1)/(2√2)
So 2*(1/(2√2))*√6 = (√6)/(√2) = √(6/2) = √3 ≈ 1.732

4*(1/√2) = 4/√2 = 2√2 ≈ 2.828

(1/√2)^2 = 1/2, so (1/2)*√3 ≈ 0.866

√2 ≈1.414

Now, adding up:

1.732 + 2.828 - 0.866 -1.414 = ?

1.732 + 2.828 = 4.56

0.866 +1.414 = 2.28

So 4.56 - 2.28 = 2.28 ≠ 0. Not zero. So t=1/√2 is not a solution.

Next, let's try t=1/2√2, which is option D's t. Wait, option D is x=1/8, so t=√(1/8)=1/(2√2)≈0.353.

Plugging t=1/(2√2) into the equation:

2*(1/(2√2))^3 *√6 +4*(1/(2√2)) - (1/(2√2))^2 *√3 - √2

Calculating each term:

(1/(2√2))^3 = 1/(8*(2√2)) )? Wait, no. Let me compute (1/(2√2))^3:

= 1^3 / (2√2)^3 = 1/(8*(2√2)) )= 1/(16√2)

So 2 * [1/(16√2)] *√6 = (√6)/(8√2) = (√6)/(8√2) = (√(6/2))/8 = √3/8 ≈ 0.216

4*(1/(2√2)) = 4/(2√2) = 2/√2 = √2 ≈1.414

(1/(2√2))^2 = 1/(4*2) = 1/8

So (1/8)*√3 ≈ 0.216

√2 ≈1.414

Putting it all together:

0.216 + 1.414 - 0.216 -1.414 = 0

Wait, 0.216 +1.414 = 1.63, and 0.216 +1.414=1.63. So 1.63 -1.63 =0. So the left side equals zero. So t=1/(2√2) is a solution.

But wait, t=1/(2√2) is sqrt(x)=1/(2√2), so x = [1/(2√2)]² = 1/(8*2) )= 1/16? Wait, no. Let me compute:

t = 1/(2√2) → t² = (1/(2√2))² = 1/(4*2) = 1/8. So x=1/8, which is option D. But wait, let me check.

Wait, when I substituted t=1/(2√2), which is x= (1/(2√2))²=1/(8). So x=1/8 is option D.

Wait, but earlier when I tried t=1/2, which is x=1/4 (option B), it didn't work. But when I tried t=1/(2√2), which is x=1/8, it worked. So x=1/8 is a solution.

Wait, but let me check if I made any calculation errors. Let me go through the substitution again for t=1/(2√2):

Left side:

2t³√6 +4t - t²√3 - √2

t =1/(2√2)

t³ = [1/(2√2)]^3 = 1/(8*(2√2)) )=1/(16√2)

So 2t³√6 = 2*(1/(16√2)) *√6 = (2√6)/(16√2) )= (√6)/(8√2)

Simplify √6/√2 = √(6/2)=√3, so 2t³√6=√3/8.

4t=4*(1/(2√2)) = 2/(√2) = √2.

t²= [1/(2√2)]² =1/(4*2)=1/8. So t²√3= (1/8)√3.

So putting it all together:

√3/8 + √2 - (1/8)√3 - √2

= (√3/8 - √3/8) + (√2 - √2)

= 0 + 0 = 0.

Yes, that works. So x=1/8 is a solution, which is option D.

Wait, but let me check if there are other possible solutions. Maybe I should check another option to see if any other x satisfies the equation. Let's try option A: x=1/2, which gives t=√(1/2)=1/√2.

Plugging t=1/√2 into the equation:

2*(1/√2)^3 *√6 +4*(1/√2) - (1/√2)^2 *√3 - √2

Compute each term:

(1/√2)^3 =1/(2√2). So 2*(1/(2√2))*√6 = (√6)/(√2)=√3.

4*(1/√2)=4/√2=2√2.

(1/√2)^2=1/2, so (1/2)*√3=√3/2.

√2 is √2.

Now, putting it together:

√3 +2√2 - √3/2 -√2.

Combine like terms:

√3 - √3/2 = √3/2

2√2 -√2 =√2

So total is √3/2 +√2 ≈ 0.866 +1.414 ≈2.28 ≠0. So not a solution.

How about option H: x=1/3, which is t=√(1/3)=1/√3≈0.577.

Plug into equation:

2*(1/√3)^3 *√6 +4*(1/√3) - (1/√3)^2 *√3 -√2.

Compute each term:

(1/√3)^3=1/(3√3). So 2*(1/(3√3))*√6 = 2√6/(3√3)= 2√(6/3)/3 = 2√2/3.

4*(1/√3)=4/√3= (4√3)/3.

(1/√3)^2=1/3, so (1/3)*√3=√3/3.

So substituting:

2√2/3 + (4√3)/3 - √3/3 -√2.

Combine terms:

2√2/3 -√2 = (2√2 -3√2)/3 = (-√2)/3.

(4√3/3 -√3/3)= 3√3/3=√3.

So total: (-√2/3) +√3 ≈ (-0.471) +1.732 ≈1.261 ≠0.

Not zero.

How about option F: x=2/3, t=√(2/3)=√6/3≈0.816.

Plug into equation:

2*(√6/3)^3 *√6 +4*(√6/3) - (√6/3)^2 *√3 -√2.

Compute each term:

(√6/3)^3 = (6√6)/(27)= (2√6)/9.

2*(2√6/9)*√6= 2*(2*6)/9= 2*(12/9)=24/9=8/3.

4*(√6/3)=4√6/3.

(√6/3)^2=6/9=2/3. So (2/3)*√3=2√3/3.

So substituting:

8/3 +4√6/3 - 2√3/3 -√2.

Hmm, this is messy. Let me compute numerically:

8/3 ≈2.666, 4√6/3≈4*2.449/3≈9.796/3≈3.265, 2√3/3≈3.464/3≈1.155, √2≈1.414.

So total: 2.666 +3.265 =5.931; 1.155 +1.414=2.569. So 5.931 -2.569≈3.362≠0.

Not zero.

Another option: option I: x=3/2, t=√(3/2)=√6/2≈1.225.

Plug into equation:

2*(√6/2)^3 *√6 +4*(√6/2) - (√6/2)^2 *√3 -√2.

Compute each term:

(√6/2)^3 = (6√6)/(8)= (3√6)/4.

2*(3√6/4)*√6= 2*(3*6)/4= 36/4=9.

4*(√6/2)=2√6≈4.899.

(√6/2)^2=6/4=3/2. So 3/2 *√3≈2.598.

So substituting:

9 +4.899 -2.598 -1.414≈9+4.899=13.899; 2.598+1.414≈4.012. So 13.899-4.012≈9.887≠0.

Not zero.

Another option: option C: x=3/4, t=√(3/4)=√3/2≈0.866.

Plug into equation:

2*(√3/2)^3 *√6 +4*(√3/2) - (√3/2)^2 *√3 -√2.

Compute each term:

(√3/2)^3= (3√3)/(8).

2*(3√3/8)*√6=2*(3√18)/8=2*(3*3√2)/8= 2*(9√2)/8= (9√2)/4 ≈3.182.

4*(√3/2)=2√3≈3.464.

(√3/2)^2=3/4. So 3/4 *√3≈1.299.

√2≈1.414.

So substituting:

3.182 +3.464 =6.646; 1.299 +1.414=2.713. So 6.646 -2.713≈3.933≠0.

Not zero.

How about option E: x=2/5, t=√(2/5)=√10/5≈0.632.

Plug into equation:

2*(√10/5)^3 *√6 +4*(√10/5) - (√10/5)^2 *√3 -√2.

This seems complicated. Let me compute each term.

(√10/5)^3=10√10/(125)= (2√10)/25.

2*(2√10/25)*√6=4√60/25=4*(2√15)/25=8√15/25≈8*3.872/25≈30.976/25≈1.239.

4*(√10/5)=4√10/5≈4*3.162/5≈12.648/5≈2.5296.

(√10/5)^2=10/25=2/5. So 2/5 *√3≈0.4*1.732≈0.6928.

√2≈1.414.

So substituting:

1.239 +2.5296≈3.7686; 0.6928 +1.414≈2.1068. So 3.7686 -2.1068≈1.6618≠0.

Not zero.

Option G: x=5/2, t=√(5/2)=√10/2≈1.581.

Plug into equation:

2*(√10/2)^3 *√6 +4*(√10/2) - (√10/2)^2 *√3 -√2.

Compute each term:

(√10/2)^3=10√10/(8)=5√10/4.

2*(5√10/4)*√6=10√60/4=10*(2√15)/4=20√15/4=5√15≈19.365.

4*(√10/2)=2√10≈6.324.

(√10/2)^2=10/4=2.5. So 2.5*√3≈2.5*1.732≈4.33.

√2≈1.414.

So substituting:

19.365 +6.324≈25.689; 4.33 +1.414≈5.744. So 25.689 -5.744≈19.945≠0.

Not zero.

Option J: x=1/16, t=1/4.

Plug into equation:

2*(1/4)^3 *√6 +4*(1/4) - (1/4)^2 *√3 -√2.

Compute each term:

(1/4)^3=1/64. So 2*(1/64)*√6= √6/32≈0.061.

4*(1/4)=1.

(1/4)^2=1/16. So 1/16 *√3≈0.108.

√2≈1.414.

So substituting:

0.061 +1 -0.108 -1.414≈(1.061) - (1.522)= -0.461≠0.

Not zero.

So far, only option D: x=1/8 gives a solution. Let me check if I made any mistake with option D's substitution.

Wait, when I substituted t=1/(2√2), which is x=1/8, the equation worked out to zero. So yes, D is a solution.

But wait, is there another possible solution? Sometimes when you square both sides or cross-multiply, you can introduce extraneous solutions. But in this case, I only found one valid solution. Let me check once more.

The original equation is:

√x / (x√3 + √2) = 1 / (2x√6 +4)

If x=1/8, let's compute both sides.

Left side numerator: √(1/8)=1/(2√2).

Denominator: (1/8)*√3 +√2 = √3/8 +√2.

So left side: [1/(2√2)] / [√3/8 +√2].

Right side: 1 / [2*(1/8)*√6 +4] =1/[ (√6/4) +4 ].

Let me compute left side:

Denominator: √3/8 +√2 = (√3 +8√2)/8.

So left side: [1/(2√2)] / [ (√3 +8√2)/8 ] = [1/(2√2)] * [8/(√3 +8√2)] = 8/(2√2*(√3 +8√2)) = 4/(√2*(√3 +8√2)).

Multiply numerator and denominator by √2:

4√2/(√2*√3 +8*2) =4√2/(√6 +16).

Right side: 1/[ (√6/4) +4 ] = 1/[ (√6 +16)/4 ] =4/(√6 +16).

So left side:4√2/(√6 +16), right side:4/(√6 +16).

But 4√2/(√6 +16) equals 4/(√6 +16) only if √2=1, which is not true. Wait, this is a problem. Did I make a mistake in substitution?

Wait, that suggests that when x=1/8, the equation doesn't hold. But earlier substitution in terms of t gave zero. There must be a mistake.

Wait, no. Let me recompute the left and right sides when x=1/8.

Compute left side:

√x = √(1/8)=1/(2√2).

Denominator: x√3 +√2= (1/8)√3 +√2=√3/8 +√2.

So left side: (1/(2√2)) / (√3/8 +√2).

Compute right side:

Denominator: 2x√6 +4=2*(1/8)*√6 +4=√6/4 +4.

So right side:1/(√6/4 +4).

Let me compute both sides numerically.

Left side:

Numerator:1/(2√2)=1/(2*1.414)=1/2.828≈0.3535.

Denominator:√3/8 +√2≈1.732/8 +1.414≈0.2165 +1.414≈1.6305.

So left side≈0.3535 /1.6305≈0.216.

Right side denominator:√6/4 +4≈2.449/4 +4≈0.612 +4=4.612.

So right side≈1/4.612≈0.217.

These are approximately equal, considering rounding errors. So x=1/8 is indeed a solution.

Earlier, when I checked the equation after substitution with t=1/(2√2), it worked out to zero, confirming that x=1/8 is a valid solution.

Wait, but earlier when I computed the exact fractions, I thought they didn't match, but maybe I made a mistake in that step.

Wait, let's compute the left side exactly:

Left side: [1/(2√2)] / [√3/8 +√2] = [1/(2√2)] / [(√3 +8√2)/8] = [1/(2√2)] * [8/(√3 +8√2)] = 8/(2√2*(√3 +8√2))=4/(√2*(√3 +8√2)).

Multiply numerator and denominator by √2:

4√2/(√2*√3 +8*2)=4√2/(√6 +16).

Right side:1/[√6/4 +4]=1/[ (√6 +16)/4 ]=4/(√6 +16).

So left side is 4√2/(√6 +16), right side is4/(√6 +16).

So for these to be equal, 4√2=4, which implies √2=1, which is false. So this suggests that x=1/8 is not a solution, which contradicts the earlier numerical approximation.

Hmm, this is confusing. Did I make a mistake in substitution?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-express the original equation with x=1/8.

Original equation:

√x / (x√3 +√2) = 1 / (2x√6 +4).

Plugging x=1/8:

√(1/8)=1/(2√2).

Denominator left side: (1/8)√3 +√2=√3/8 +√2.

So left side: [1/(2√2)] / [√3/8 +√2].

Right side denominator:2*(1/8)*√6 +4=√6/4 +4.

So right side:1/(√6/4 +4).

Now, let me rationalize the denominator of the left side:

Left side: [1/(2√2)] / [√3/8 +√2] = [1/(2√2)] / [(√3 +8√2)/8] = [1/(2√2)] * [8/(√3 +8√2)] =8/(2√2*(√3 +8√2))=4/(√2*(√3 +8√2)).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (√3 -8√2) to rationalize:

4*(√3 -8√2)/[√2*(√3 +8√2)(√3 -8√2)].

Denominator becomes √2*( (√3)^2 - (8√2)^2 )=√2*(3 - 64*2)=√2*(3-128)=√2*(-125)= -125√2.

So left side:4*(√3 -8√2)/(-125√2)= -4*(√3 -8√2)/(125√2).

Simplify numerator:

-4√3 +32√2.

Divide by denominator:

(-4√3)/(125√2) +32√2/(125√2)= (-4√3)/(125√2) +32/(125).

Simplify each term:

(-4√3)/(125√2)= (-4√(3/2))/125= (-4*(√6)/2)/125= (-2√6)/125.

32/125 remains as is.

So left side≈ (-2√6 +32)/125.

Right side:1/(√6/4 +4)=1/[ (√6 +16)/4 ]=4/(√6 +16).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (√6 -16):

4*(√6 -16)/[ (√6)^2 -16^2 ]=4*(√6 -16)/(6 -256)=4*(√6 -16)/(-250)= -4*(√6 -16)/250= (-4√6 +64)/250= (-2√6 +32)/125.

Which matches the left side after rationalization. So they are equal. Therefore, x=1/8 is indeed a solution.

So the correct answer is option D: 1/8.
</think>

The solution involves cross-multiplying and substituting to find that \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) satisfies the equation.

Answer: D
