Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about preparing sodium sulfate, Na2SO4, using a series of reactions. The question is asking how many moles of Na2SO4 can be produced starting with 1 mole of sulfur and then, separately, how many moles if I start with 4.5 grams of water. There are multiple options to choose from, labeled A to J.

Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on stoichiometry, but I'll take it slow.

First, I need to look at the reactions provided:

1. S(s) + O2(g) → SO2(g)
2. 2SO2(g) + O2(g) → 2SO3(g)
3. SO3(g) + H2O(l) → H2SO4(l)
4. 2NaOH + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + 2H2O

So the overall process starts with sulfur and goes through several steps to make sodium sulfate. The question is about the moles produced based on the starting amounts of sulfur and water.

Let me tackle each part separately.

**Part 1: Starting with 1 mole of Sulfur (S)**

The first reaction is S → SO2. So 1 mole of S produces 1 mole of SO2.

Next, the second reaction takes 2 moles of SO2 to produce 2 moles of SO3. So for every mole of SO2, we get 1 mole of SO3. Since we have 1 mole of SO2 from the first step, that will yield 1 mole of SO3.

Third reaction: 1 mole of SO3 reacts with H2O to make 1 mole of H2SO4. So 1 mole of H2SO4 produced.

Fourth reaction: H2SO4 reacts with NaOH to make Na2SO4. The balanced equation is 2NaOH + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + 2H2O. So 1 mole of H2SO4 will produce 1 mole of Na2SO4, assuming there's enough NaOH.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the amount of NaOH available. It just asks about starting with sulfur and water. So perhaps the limiting reagent is either sulfur or water, depending on the part of the question.

Wait, but for part 1, we're starting with 1 mole of S, and the reactions proceed as written. So assuming all steps go to completion, how much Na2SO4 do we get?

Let me outline the steps:

- S → SO2: 1 mole → 1 mole SO2.
- SO2 → SO3: 1 mole SO2 → 1 mole SO3.
- SO3 → H2SO4: 1 mole → 1 mole H2SO4.
- H2SO4 → Na2SO4: 1 mole H2SO4 → 1 mole Na2SO4.

So from 1 mole S, we get 1 mole Na2SO4. That's assuming all steps are 100% efficient and there's enough of all other reactants (O2, H2O, NaOH) available.

But wait, in reality, we'd have to consider the availability of O2 and H2O. But the problem states that the sequence can be used to prepare Na2SO4. So perhaps O2 is in excess, as it's a gas and likely provided in ample amounts. The H2O is part of the third step, so if we're starting with 1 mole of S, but in part 1, the water is not the limiting factor because the first part is about the moles from sulfur, and the second part is about water. Wait, no, the question is two separate parts: first, how much from 1 mole of S, and second, how much from 4.5 g of H2O.

Wait, no, perhaps the second part is the second scenario, so when considering 4.5g H2O, perhaps that's the limiting reagent in that scenario.

Wait, but in the first part, when starting with 1 mole of S, the amount of H2O required would determine if that's a limiting factor. Because in the third reaction, SO3 + H2O → H2SO4. So how much H2O is needed for 1 mole of SO3?

Let me see: 1 mole of SO3 requires 1 mole of H2O to produce 1 mole of H2SO4. So if the H2O is not limiting, then 1 mole of Na2SO4 is possible. But if H2O is the limiting reagent, then it's determined by that.

Wait, but the problem says in the first part, how many moles from 1 mole of S. So maybe the water is not the limiting factor here, but perhaps in the second part, when starting with 4.5g H2O, that is the limiting factor.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-express the steps.

Each step's stoichiometry:

1. S → SO2: 1 mole S → 1 mole SO2.
2. 2 SO2 → 2 SO3: So 1 mole SO2 → 1 mole SO3.
3. SO3 + H2O → H2SO4: 1 mole SO3 → 1 mole H2SO4, using 1 mole H2O.
4. H2SO4 + 2 NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O: 1 mole H2SO4 → 1 mole Na2SO4.

So, the key is to see how much H2O is needed in step 3. For 1 mole of S, we need 1 mole of H2O. But if we only have, say, 0.5 moles of H2O, then only 0.5 moles of H2SO4 would be made, and thus 0.5 moles of Na2SO4.

Wait, but in part 1, the question is starting with 1 mole of S. It doesn't mention the amount of H2O. So perhaps we're assuming that H2O is in excess, so the limiting factor is S. So from 1 mole S, we get 1 mole Na2SO4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says 1 mole for the first part, and 1 mole for the second. But in the second part, the starting point is 4.5g H2O, which may limit production.

Wait, let me calculate how much H2O is in 4.5g.

Molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 4.5g / 18 g/mol = 0.25 moles of H2O.

So in the second scenario, with 0.25 moles of H2O, how much Na2SO4 can be produced?

Let me outline the steps again, but this time, H2O is the starting point.

Wait, no. The second question is, how many moles of Na2SO4 can be produced with 4.5g (0.25 moles) of H2O. So perhaps the H2O is the limiting reagent.

But wait, the entire process involves multiple steps. Let me map it out.

We can think of the overall process as S → H2SO4 → Na2SO4.

But to get H2SO4, we need SO3 and H2O. So the amount of H2O will limit the amount of H2SO4, which in turn limits the amount of Na2SO4.

But let me think in terms of moles.

Assuming that the H2O is the limiting reagent, how much Na2SO4 can be made?

Each mole of H2O produces 1 mole of H2SO4, which then produces 1 mole of Na2SO4.

So 0.25 moles H2O → 0.25 moles H2SO4 → 0.25 moles Na2SO4.

Wait, but that would mean option D for the second part, which is 0.25 moles. But looking at the options, option D has 1 mole for the first part and 0.25 for the second.

Wait, but in the first part, if I have 1 mole of S, but only limited by H2O, then perhaps the first part also depends on H2O availability. Wait, no, because the first part is when starting with 1 mole of S, but the second part is starting with 4.5g H2O. So the first scenario isn't limited by H2O; it's assuming that H2O is sufficient. So from 1 mole S, we get 1 mole Na2SO4.

But wait, looking at the options, option C says both parts are 1 mole. However, another possibility is that the amount of H2O required for 1 mole of S is 1 mole, so if only 4.5g (0.25 moles) is available, that's the limiting factor.

But wait, the first part is about starting with 1 mole of S, so in that case, assuming H2O is available in sufficient quantity, the Na2SO4 produced would be 1 mole.

The second part is starting with 4.5g of H2O, which is 0.25 moles. So how much Na2SO4 can be made from that?

But wait, the process requires that H2O is used in the third step, which is to make H2SO4 from SO3. So each mole of H2O gives a mole of H2SO4, which gives a mole of Na2SO4.

So 0.25 moles H2O → 0.25 moles H2SO4 → 0.25 moles Na2SO4.

But wait, I'm not considering the steps before H2O. Because to get H2O into the reaction, we need SO3 first, which comes from SO2, which comes from S and O2.

So perhaps the entire process requires that the amount of H2O determines how much Na2SO4 can be produced.

Wait, but if H2O is 0.25 moles, then the maximum Na2SO4 is 0.25 moles.

But looking at the options, option D has 1 mole for the first part and 0.25 for the second.

Option D: 1 mole, 0.25 mole.

But let me double-check.

So, first part: 1 mole S → 1 mole Na2SO4.

Second part: 4.5g H2O = 0.25 moles → 0.25 moles Na2SO4.

So the first part is 1 mole, the second is 0.25, which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is:

D: 1 mole of Na2SO4, 0.25 moles of Na2SO4.

Yes, that matches.

Wait, but let me think again. Another possibility is that the H2O is the limiting reagent in both scenarios. Because in the first scenario, starting with 1 mole S, we need 1 mole H2O, but perhaps the available H2O is only 0.25 moles. But the question says in the first part, starting with 1 mole of S, so perhaps H2O is not the limiting factor there. So in that case, the first part would be 1 mole, and the second part would be 0.25.

So the answer would be D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the second part, the starting point is 4.5g of H2O, which would be 0.25 moles. So the maximum Na2SO4 would be 0.25 moles.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me outline all steps again.

For the first scenario: 1 mole S.

1. S → SO2: 1 mole S → 1 mole SO2.
2. SO2 → SO3: 1 mole SO2 → 1 mole SO3.
3. SO3 + H2O → H2SO4: 1 mole SO3 needs 1 mole H2O. So if H2O is available, 1 mole H2SO4.
4. H2SO4 + 2 NaOH → Na2SO4: 1 mole H2SO4 → 1 mole Na2SO4.

Assuming H2O is available, so 1 mole Na2SO4.

Second scenario: 4.5g H2O → 0.25 moles.

Now, how much Na2SO4 can be made?

Each mole of H2O gives 1 mole H2SO4, which gives 1 mole Na2SO4.

So 0.25 moles H2O → 0.25 moles Na2SO4.

But wait, the process requires that SO3 is available. To get SO3, we need SO2, which comes from S. So if H2O is the limiting factor, the amount of S required would be 0.25 moles, because each mole of H2O requires 1 mole of SO3, which comes from 1 mole of SO2, which comes from 1 mole of S.

Wait, so if I have only 0.25 moles of H2O, then I can only process 0.25 moles of S, leading to 0.25 moles of Na2SO4.

But the question is, when starting with 4.5g of water, how much Na2SO4 can be produced. So the water is the limiting factor, so the answer is 0.25 moles.

So the first part is 1 mole, the second is 0.25 moles.

Looking at the options, option D says 1 mole and 0.25 moles, which matches.

To determine the number of moles of sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄) produced, we analyze the given reactions step by step.

### Part 1: Starting with 1 mole of Sulfur (S)
1. **Reaction 1**: S → SO₂.  
   - 1 mole of S produces 1 mole of SO₂.
2. **Reaction 2**: 2 SO₂ → 2 SO₃.  
   - 1 mole of SO₂ produces 1 mole of SO₃.
3. **Reaction 3**: SO₃ + H₂O → H₂SO₄.  
   - 1 mole of SO₃ reacts with 1 mole of H₂O to produce 1 mole of H₂SO₄.
4. **Reaction 4**: H₂SO₄ + 2 NaOH → Na₂SO₄ + 2 H₂O.  
   - 1 mole of H₂SO₄ produces 1 mole of Na₂SO₄.

Assuming sufficient availability of O₂, H₂O, and NaOH, 1 mole of S produces 1 mole of Na₂SO₄.

### Part 2: Starting with 4.5 g of Water (H₂O)
1. **Moles of H₂O**:  
   - Molar mass of H₂O = 18 g/mol.  
   - Moles of H₂O = 4.5 g / 18 g/mol = 0.25 moles.
2. **Reaction 3**: SO₃ + H₂O → H₂SO₄.  
   - 1 mole of H₂O produces 1 mole of H₂SO₄.
3. **Reaction 4**: H₂SO₄ → Na₂SO₄.  
   - 1 mole of H₂SO₄ produces 1 mole of Na₂SO₄.

Thus, 0.25 moles of H₂O produce 0.25 moles of Na₂SO₄.

### Conclusion
- From 1 mole of S, **1 mole of Na₂SO₄** is produced.  
- From 4.5 g of H₂O, **0.25 moles of Na₂SO₄** are produced.

The correct answer is **D: 1 mole of Na₂SO₄, 0.25 moles of Na₂SO₄**.
