Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the following governmental report.
Of the 450 sick persons whom the inhabitants were unable to relieve, 200 were turned out, and these we saw die one by one as they lay on the roadside. A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rhétel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the curé, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.
—Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651
Which of the following would be most responsible for ending the problems of hunger mentioned above?

Options:

A: The development of a welfare system to support those in need
B: The increase in population during the seventeenth century leading to more workers in the field
C: The discovery of new trade routes that brought in more food
D: The elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution during the seventeenth century
E: The introduction of new crops from the New World during the Columbian Exchange
F: The implementation of a universal basic income
G: The elimination of the Black Plague in Europe during the seventeenth century
H: The creation of a strong putting-out system that allowed people to be paid for their work
I: A declining population during the seventeenth century that led to better food yields and less hunger as Europe urbanized

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a historical governmental report from 1651 in Normandy. The report is really dire, talking about hundreds of people dying from famine, people eating mice and roots, and the parish priest burying those who starved. It's a pretty惨痛的状况.

The question is asking which option would most likely end the hunger problems described. The options are from A to I. I need to think about each one and see which makes the most sense in the context of 17th-century Europe.

First, let me read through the options again:

A: Welfare system
B: Population increase leading to more workers
C: New trade routes bringing more food
D: Eliminating fallow fields through agriculture revolution
E: Introduction of new crops from the Columbian Exchange
F: Universal basic income
G: Elimination of the Black Plague
H: Putting-out system (like home-based manufacturing)
I: Declining population leading to better yields and urbanization

The problem described is a severe famine, so the solution would need to address the root causes of the hunger. Let's think about each option.

Option A: Welfare system. In 1651, Europe was just beginning to develop welfare systems, but it's not clear if this would solve the immediate food shortage. Welfare might help people survive but might not address the lack of food production.

Option B: Population increase. More people usually mean more mouths to feed, but in the 17th century, population growth was a factor leading to strain on resources, so this might worsen the problem rather than solve it.

Option C: New trade routes for food. If more food could be imported, that might help, but the report seems to be about local conditions, not trade. Plus, in the 17th century, trade was growing, but whether it would bring enough food quickly is questionable.

Option D: Eliminating fallow fields through agricultural revolution. Fallow fields were a way to let land rest to maintain fertility. If they eliminated fallow fields, they could potentially increase food production. The agricultural revolution, though, really started to take hold later, in the 18th century. But maybe the idea here is that better farming practices could increase yields.

Option E: New crops from Columbian Exchange. This happened in the 16th century, introducing potatoes, corn, etc. By 1651, some regions might have adopted these, but the report doesn't mention anything about crop types, so maybe not directly relevant.

Option F: Universal basic income. This is a modern concept, likely not something that existed in 17th-century Normandy. Plus, income wouldn't directly solve the food production issue.

Option G: Eliminating Black Plague. The Black Plague had mostly subsided by the 17th century, but its effects on population and labor dynamics might have contributed to some economic changes. However, the report is about a current famine, not the lingering effects of the plague.

Option H: Putting-out system. This relates more to the economy and industrial practices, allowing people to work from home. It might provide some income but doesn't directly address food shortages.

Option I: Declining population leading to better yields and urbanization. A declining population would mean fewer people to feed, which could reduce hunger. It also might lead to more efficient farming as fewer people are available to work the land, potentially increasing per capita production. Urbanization could shift labor to cities, freeing up rural areas for more efficient agricultural practices.

Looking back at the report, it's a time of severe famine, likely due to a combination of factors like poor harvests, war, or economic issues. The problem is immediate, so a solution that can increase food production or reduce the number of people needing food would help.

Option D suggests an agricultural revolution, but the agricultural revolution in Europe really started to gain momentum in the 18th century with better machinery and techniques. In the 17th century, it was still early. However, if fallow fields were eliminated, it could increase the amount of land used for crops, thus increasing food production.

Option I, a declining population, would mean there are fewer people to feed, which could alleviate hunger. If the population decreases, the same amount of food can go further. Additionally, urbanization might lead to more efficient food distribution and possibly better agricultural practices as rural areas become less labor-dependent.

Wait, but the report mentions that many people are starving despite living in rural areas, so maybe the population density is part of the problem. If the population decreases, the land can be farmed more efficiently, and people might move to cities where food distribution is better managed.

Alternatively, option D's agricultural changes could increase food production, but the timing might be off since the full agricultural revolution was later. Option I's declining population seems more plausible for the time period given.

Another angle: The report talks about people turning to extreme measures like eating roots and mice, indicating a severe lack of food. The root cause could be a combination of war, bad harvests, and possibly economic policies. But looking for the most responsible factor among the options.

So, between D and I. Option D suggests the agricultural revolution eliminating fallow fields. If that happened, more land would be used for crops, increasing food supply. But in the 17th century, the agricultural revolution was just beginning, so maybe it's not the main solution yet.

Option I: If the population declined, it would immediately reduce the number of people affected by famine. Plus, with fewer people, the land could be farmed more efficiently, leading to better yields per person. Urbanization might also lead to better organization of food distribution.

I think the answer is I. A declining population would lead to better food yields and less hunger because there are fewer people to feed, and resources can be better allocated. It's a combination of reduced demand and possibly more efficient use of available resources.

Wait, but some sources say that in the 17th century, Europe experienced population growth after the Black Death, so a decline might not be the case. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the timelines. The Black Plague was in the mid-14th century, and its effects lingered for centuries. By the 17th century, the population was starting to recover in some areas. So a declining population during the 17th century might not be accurate. That complicates things.

If the population was increasing, that would worsen the problem, which is option B, but option B says increase leads to more workers. But more workers without more food would lead to more hunger, not less.

Alternatively, maybe the problem was due to the Little Ice Age causing bad harvests. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, the question is about what would end the problems. If the population declined, even temporarily, it might help. Or if trade increased, bringing more food. Or if welfare systems were developed to support those in need.

But the report is from 1651, which is during the time when the agricultural practices were still traditional. So without better farming methods, how would they increase production?

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The problem is severe hunger due to food shortages. The options that could address this are either increasing food production (D) or reducing the number of people (I). Since the agricultural revolution is more about production, but it's not fully implemented yet, maybe the answer is I.

Wait, but Option I says a declining population leading to better yields and less hunger as Europe urbanized. If the population declined, there would be more land per person, allowing for better yields. Also, urbanization might lead to more efficient food distribution and possibly better agricultural techniques as people move to cities and leave rural areas less overpopulated.

So, given that, I think the answer is I.

The question refers to a governmental report from 1651 describing severe famine in Normandy, with hundreds dying from hunger and people resorting to extreme measures to survive. The task is to identify which option would most effectively address the hunger problems described.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: A welfare system might help people survive but wouldn't directly solve the food production issue.
- **B**: Population increase would likely worsen the problem by adding more mouths to feed.
- **C**: New trade routes could bring food, but the report focuses on local conditions, not trade.
- **D**: Eliminating fallow fields through agriculture could increase food production, but the agricultural revolution was just beginning in the 17th century.
- **E**: New crops from the Columbian Exchange were already available but aren't directly mentioned as a solution.
- **F**: Universal basic income is a modern concept and wouldn't address food production.
- **G**: The Black Plague had already subsided, so its elimination wouldn't directly help.
- **H**: A putting-out system relates more to economics than food shortages.
- **I**: A declining population would reduce the number of people needing food and allow for more efficient farming, potentially increasing yields per capita.

Given the context, a declining population (Option I) would alleviate hunger by reducing the number of people affected and enabling better resource allocation and agricultural efficiency. This makes Option I the most plausible solution.

Answer: I
