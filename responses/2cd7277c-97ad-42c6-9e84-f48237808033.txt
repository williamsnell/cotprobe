Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

An object with a mass of 100 grams is at rest. Then, a net force of 2000 dynes is applied for 10 seconds. I need to find two things: the final velocity and how far the object moves in those 10 seconds. The options are labeled A to J, each giving a velocity and a distance. I'll have to compute both and match them to one of the options.

First, I should remember the basic physics principles involved here. Since the object is initially at rest, its initial velocity (u) is zero. When a force is applied, it will cause acceleration, and from there, I can find the velocity and the distance moved.

I know Newton's second law, F = m * a, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration. But wait, the units here are in grams and dynes, which aren't the standard SI units. I need to make sure I convert them correctly.

Mass is given as 100 grams. I remember that 1 kilogram is 1000 grams, so 100 grams is 0.1 kilograms. But wait, sometimes in physics problems, when dealing with dynes, it's easier to work in the cgs system, where mass is in grams, force in dynes, and acceleration in cm/s².

Let me think: 1 dyne is the force that causes a 1 gram mass to accelerate at 1 cm/s². So, F = m * a → a = F/m. Here, F is 2000 dynes, and m is 100 grams.

So, a = 2000 dynes / 100 grams = 20 cm/s². That makes the acceleration 20 cm/s².

Now, to find the final velocity after 10 seconds. The formula for velocity when starting from rest is v = u + a*t. Since u is 0, v = a*t.

a is 20 cm/s², t is 10 s. So v = 20 * 10 = 200 cm/s. Hmm, looking at the options, I see E is 200 cm/s and 10 m. But wait, let me check the distance part too because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Let me calculate the distance as well. The formula for distance when starting from rest is s = 0.5 * a * t². So s = 0.5 * 20 * (10)^2.

Calculating that: 0.5 * 20 is 10, and 10 * 100 (since 10^2 is 100) is 1000 cm. Wait, 1000 cm is 10 meters. So s is 10 meters.

So the velocity is 200 cm/s and the distance is 10 m. Looking at the options, that's option E: 200 cm/s and 10 m.

Wait a minute, but looking back, I thought the options included E as 200 cm/s and 10 m. But I should double-check my calculations to make sure.

Wait, let me recheck the acceleration. Force is 2000 dynes, mass is 100 grams. So a = 2000 / 100 = 20 cm/s². That's right.

Velocity after 10 seconds: 20 * 10 = 200 cm/s. Correct.

Distance: 0.5 * 20 * (10)^2 = 0.5 * 20 * 100 = 0.5 * 2000 = 1000 cm, which is 10 meters. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, looking at the options again, option E is 200 cm/s and 10 m. So that's the one.
</think>

The object has a mass of 100 grams (0.1 kg) and is initially at rest. A force of 2000 dynes is applied for 10 seconds. Using Newton's second law, the acceleration is calculated as \( a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{2000 \, \text{dynes}}{100 \, \text{g}} = 20 \, \text{cm/s}^2 \). The final velocity after 10 seconds is \( v = u + a \cdot t = 0 + 20 \cdot 10 = 200 \, \text{cm/s} \). The distance traveled is \( s = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 20 \cdot 10^2 = 1000 \, \text{cm} = 10 \, \text{m} \). Matching these values, the correct option is E.
