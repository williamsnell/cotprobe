Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which formula best represents the sentence "Dylan likes neither math nor science." I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to break down the sentence. "Dylan likes neither math nor science." So, Dylan doesn't like math and he also doesn't like science. That sounds like two separate negations: not liking math and not liking science. So, both have to be true for the sentence to hold.

In logic, when we say someone likes neither of two things, it's a case where both are disliked. So, if M stands for "Dylan likes math" and S stands for "Dylan likes science," the sentence would translate to Dylan not liking math AND not liking science.

Looking at logical connectives, "neither... nor..." typically corresponds to a conjunction of two negations. So, that would be ~M (not M) and ~S (not S). The word "nor" usually indicates an 'and' after a negation, but in this case, it's about both not being liked, so it's an 'and' between the two negatives.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C is ~M ∧ ~S. That seems to fit because it's both not liking math and not liking science.

Option J is ~M ∨ ~S. That would mean either he doesn't like math or he doesn't like science. But the original sentence requires both, so J is an OR, which is too broad because it allows for cases where maybe he doesn't like one but does like the other, which isn't what the sentence says.

Option H is ~(M ∨ S). That's the negation of (M or S), which would mean it's not the case that he likes math or science. That actually also fits because if he likes neither, then it's not true that he likes at least one. But wait, I thought it was an AND of the two negations. So, is ~(M ∨ S) equivalent to ~M ∧ ~S? Oh, right! De Morgan's laws say that ~(A ∨ B) is equivalent to ~A ∧ ~B. So H and C are actually equivalent. Hmm, so which one is better?

Wait, the question is asking for the best symbolization. Both H and C represent the same thing, but the options are separate. So why are both present?

Wait, let me check the options again. Option C is ~M ∧ ~S, which is the direct translation. Option H is the negation of an OR, which also works but might be less direct. But in terms of PL formulas, both are correct because they're logically equivalent.

Wait, but the options are separate, so which one is considered the best? The sentence is about neither, which is a stronger statement than just not liking at least one. So, I think the direct symbolization would be ~M ∧ ~S, which is option C. Alternatively, using De Morgan's, option H is also correct. But looking back, the question is about the best symbolization. So, perhaps option J is another possibility.

Wait, no. Option J is ~M ∨ ~S. That would mean either he doesn't like math or he doesn't like science, but the original sentence requires both. So J is not correct because it allows for cases where he might not like one but likes the other.

So, between C and H: both are correct, but the question is about the best symbolization. Since the original sentence can be directly broken down into both ~M and ~S, option C is more straightforward. Alternatively, option H is a more compact way using De Morgan's law, but maybe the question expects the direct breakdown.

Wait, let me think again. The sentence "neither nor" can be represented as the negation of the disjunction. So, "neither M nor S" is the same as "it is not the case that M or S." So that's ~(M ∨ S), which is option H.

So, which is more appropriate? Both C and H are correct, but perhaps H is the better symbolization because "neither nor" is a common way to express the negation of an OR. So, the answer might be H.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because both C and H are correct. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

C: ~M ∧ ~S

H: ~(M ∨ S)

So, the question is which is the best symbolization. I think both are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is C because it directly translates to the two negations. However, in formal logic, H is also correct as it's equivalent.

Wait, the problem is asking for the best symbolization. In PL, the direct translation would be ~M ∧ ~S, which is C. So, perhaps the answer is C.

Alternatively, sometimes "neither nor" is symbolized as the negation of the OR, which is H. So, I'm a bit torn between C and H.

Wait, let me think about the structure. "Dylan likes neither math nor science." That's the same as saying Dylan does not like math and Dylan does not like science. So, that's two separate facts. So, the formula would be ~M ∧ ~S, which is option C.

Therefore, the best symbolization is C.

The sentence "Dylan likes neither math nor science" translates to Dylan not liking math and not liking science. In logic, this corresponds to the conjunction of two negations: ~M ∧ ~S, which is option C. 

Answer: C
