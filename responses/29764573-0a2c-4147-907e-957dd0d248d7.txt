Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about binomial random variables. I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that a binomial random variable has specific characteristics. It must satisfy four conditions: each trial is independent, there are a fixed number of trials, each trial has two possible outcomes (success or failure), and the probability of success remains constant for each trial.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The number of motorists not wearing seat belts in a random sample of five drivers. Hmm, so each driver is a trial. The outcome is either wearing a seat belt (success, maybe) or not. Wait, but the question is about not wearing seat belts. So, not wearing could be considered a 'success' here. There are five trials, each independent, and the probability of not wearing a seat belt is the same each time. So this seems binomial. But let me check the other options.

Option B: The number of hearts out of five cards drawn from a deck without replacement. Wait, without replacement means each trial isn't independent because the probability changes after each draw. For example, if you draw a heart first, there are fewer hearts left. So the probability isn't constant, so this isn't binomial. It would be hypergeometric instead, I think.

Option C: The number of tosses before a "5" appears when tossing a die. This sounds like a geometric distribution, which models the number of trials until the first success. But binomial is about the number of successes in a fixed number of trials, not the number of trials until a success. So C isn't binomial.

Option D: The number of green marbles drawn from a bag with red, blue, and green marbles. Wait, this depends on whether the draws are with replacement or not. If it's without replacement, like option B, then the trials aren't independent, so it's not binomial. But if it's with replacement, then each draw is independent. But the question doesn't specify, so I might have to assume. However, usually in such cases without mention, it's without replacement. So D might not be binomial.

Option E: The number of points a hockey team gets in 10 games. Points are awarded based on wins, ties, and losses. So each game can result in 0, 1, or 2 points. But binomial requires only two outcomes (success or failure). Here, there are three possible outcomes, so E isn't binomial.

Option F: The number of red cards in a random hand of five. Each card is either red or not, so two outcomes. Five trials, assuming each is independent (if with replacement, but usually in card draws it's without). Wait, without replacement, the trials are dependent, so the probability changes. So F would be hypergeometric, not binomial.

Option G: Time to complete a puzzle. That's a continuous variable, not discrete. Binomial counts the number of successes, so G isn't binomial.

Option H: Number of cars sold in a month. Each sale is a trial, and each can be a success (sale) or failure (no sale). But wait, each sale is a success, but the number here is the count. However, are the trials independent? If each sale is independent, then yes. But in reality, sales might depend on factors like time of year, etc., but for the sake of the question, we can assume independence. The number of trials is fixed (each potential customer is a trial?), but wait, H says the number sold, which could be any number up to the number of customers. But if we're considering a fixed number of trials, like approaching a fixed number of customers, then it's binomial. But if it's just the number sold without a fixed number of trials, then it's not. The question isn't clear, but I think H is referring to the number sold in a month, which could be seen as a binomial if each potential sale is a Bernoulli trial, but it's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe H isn't binomial because the number of trials (potential customers) isn't fixed.

Wait, going back to the options. The question is which is a binomial variable. So A seems to fit: fixed number of trials (5 drivers), each with two outcomes (seat belt or not), independent, and constant probability.

Wait but earlier I thought about A: not wearing seat belts. So the count is the number of successes (not wearing) in 5 trials, each independent, same probability. So yes, A is binomial.

So the answer should be A.

The question asks which of the given options is a binomial random variable. A binomial random variable must satisfy four conditions: a fixed number of independent trials, each trial having two possible outcomes (success or failure), a constant probability of success, and the count of successes.

**Option A**: The number of motorists not wearing seat belts in a random sample of five drivers. This fits the binomial criteria: five trials (drivers), each with two outcomes (wearing or not wearing seat belts), independent trials, and a constant probability of not wearing a seat belt.

**Option B**: The number of hearts out of five cards drawn without replacement. This is not binomial because the trials are dependent (probability changes after each draw), making it hypergeometric.

**Option C**: The number of tosses before a "5" appears. This is a geometric distribution, not binomial, as it counts trials until the first success, not the number of successes in fixed trials.

**Option D**: The number of green marbles drawn, likely without replacement, making trials dependent and not binomial.

**Option E**: The number of hockey points in 10 games with three possible outcomes per game. This is not binomial due to more than two outcomes.

**Option F**: The number of red cards in five drawn without replacement. Again, trials are dependent, making it hypergeometric, not binomial.

**Option G**: Time to complete a puzzle is continuous, not discrete, so not binomial.

**Option H**: The number of cars sold, which could be seen as binomial if considering fixed trials, but it's ambiguous and less clear than A.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as it clearly meets all binomial criteria.

Answer: A
