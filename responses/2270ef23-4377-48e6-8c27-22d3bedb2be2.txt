Question:

Ben rolls two fair six-sided dice. What is the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled? Express your answer as a fraction. (If the two numbers are the same, we take that number to be the "larger" number.)

D: \frac{161}{18}
E: \frac{161}{12}

H: \frac{161}{6}
I: \frac{161}{72}
J: \frac{161}{3}

Alright, so I've got this problem where Ben rolls two fair six-sided dice, and I need to find the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled. If they're the same, that number counts as the larger one. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with expectations, especially for functions of random variables, it's helpful to consider all possible outcomes and their probabilities. Since each die is six-sided, there are 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice. Each outcome is equally likely, so each has a probability of 1/36.

The larger number, let's call it X, can be any integer from 1 to 6. I need to find the expected value E[X], which is the sum over all possible values of X multiplied by their respective probabilities. So, E[X] = Σ (x * P(X = x)) for x from 1 to 6.

Now, I need to find P(X = x) for each x. That is, the probability that the larger of the two dice is exactly x. For the maximum to be x, both dice must be ≤ x, and at least one die must be equal to x.

Wait, so for each x, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways both dice are ≤ x minus the number of ways both are ≤ (x-1). Because if both are ≤ x, that includes cases where the max could be x or less, but subtracting both ≤ (x-1) gives exactly the cases where the max is exactly x.

Let me write that down. The number of favorable outcomes for max being x is x² - (x-1)². Let me check that: for example, when x=1, it's 1² - 0² =1, which makes sense because only (1,1) would have max 1.

For x=2, it's 2² -1²=4-1=3. Let me list those: (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). That's three outcomes, correct. So yes, that formula works.

So the number of favorable outcomes is x² - (x-1)² = 2x -1.

Wait, let me compute that: x² - (x-1)^2 = x² - (x² -2x +1) = 2x -1. Yep, that's correct.

So for each x, the number of favorable outcomes is 2x -1, and since there are 36 total, the probability P(X=x) is (2x -1)/36.

So now, the expected value E[X] is the sum from x=1 to 6 of x*(2x -1)/36.

Let me compute each term and sum them up.

For x=1: 1*(2*1 -1)=1*(2-1)=1*1=1
x=2: 2*(4-1)=2*3=6
x=3:3*(6-1)=3*5=15
x=4:4*(8-1)=4*7=28
x=5:5*(10-1)=5*9=45
x=6:6*(12-1)=6*11=66

Now, let me add these up: 1 +6=7; 7+15=22; 22+28=50; 50+45=95; 95+66=161.

So the total sum is 161. Now, since each term was divided by 36, E[X] = 161 /36.

Wait, but 161/36 is an option. Let me check the options: option F is 161/36. So the answer should be F.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Calculating each x:

x=1: 1*(2*1-1)=1*1=1 ✔️
x=2: 2*(4-1)=2*3=6 ✔️
x=3:3*(6-1)=3*5=15 ✔️
x=4:4*(8-1)=28 ✔️
x=5:5*9=45 ✔️
x=6:6*11=66 ✔️

Sum:1+6=7, +15=22, +28=50, +45=95, +66=161. Correct.

So E[X]=161/36, which is option F.
</think>

The expected value is calculated by summing each possible value multiplied by its probability. For each x, the probability is (2x -1)/36, leading to a total sum of 161. Dividing by 36 gives the expected value as 161/36.

Answer: F
