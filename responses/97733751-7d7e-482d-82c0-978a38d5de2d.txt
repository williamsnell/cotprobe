Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the curl of a vector field at the point (1, -2, 1). The vector field a is given as a = x²y²i + 2xyzj + z²k. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the curl of a vector field, denoted as ∇×a, is a vector operator. It's calculated using the determinant of a matrix with partial derivatives. The formula I recall is:

∇×a = ( ∂a_z/∂y - ∂a_y/∂z )i + ( ∂a_x/∂z - ∂a_z/∂x )j + ( ∂a_y/∂x - ∂a_x/∂y )k

So I need to compute each component step by step.

Let me write down the components of a:
a_x = x²y²
a_y = 2xyz
a_z = z²

Now, let's compute each term needed for the curl.

First component (i-direction):
∂a_z/∂y = ∂(z²)/∂y. Since z² doesn't depend on y, this derivative is 0.
∂a_y/∂z = ∂(2xyz)/∂z = 2xy.
So the i-component is 0 - 2xy = -2xy.

Second component (j-direction):
∂a_x/∂z = ∂(x²y²)/∂z. Again, x²y² doesn't depend on z, so this is 0.
∂a_z/∂x = ∂(z²)/∂x = 0. So the j-component is 0 - 0 = 0.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula for the j component is (∂a_x/∂z - ∂a_z/∂x). So ∂a_x/∂z is 0, and ∂a_z/∂x is 0. So the j-component is 0 - 0 = 0.

Third component (k-direction):
∂a_y/∂x = ∂(2xyz)/∂x = 2yz.
∂a_x/∂y = ∂(x²y²)/∂y = 2x²y.
So the k-component is 2yz - 2x²y.

Now, let's plug in the point (1, -2, 1) into each component.

First component (i-direction):
-2xy = -2*(1)*(-2) = (-2)*(-2) = 4.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, the i-component is ∂a_z/∂y - ∂a_y/∂z. So ∂a_z/∂y is 0, and ∂a_y/∂z is 2xy. So the i-component is 0 - 2xy = -2xy.

Wait, but when I plug in x=1, y=-2, so -2*(1)*(-2) = (-2)*(-2) = 4. So the i-component is 4.

Second component (j-direction) is 0, as computed.

Third component (k-direction):
2yz - 2x²y. Let's compute each term.

At (1, -2, 1):
2yz = 2*(1)*(-2) = 2*(-2) = -4.
2x²y = 2*(1)^2*(-2) = 2*(1)*(-2) = -4.
So the k-component is (-4) - (-4) = 0. Because 2yz is -4 and 2x²y is -4, so subtracting 2x²y (which is -4) is like subtracting a negative, so -4 - (-4) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check that. Wait, the formula is ∂a_y/∂x - ∂a_x/∂y. Oh wait, no, I think I have the k-component correct. Let me recompute:

At (1, -2, 1):
yz = (1)*(-2) = -2, multiplied by 2 gives 2yz = 2*(-2) = -4.
x²y = (1)^2*(-2) = -2, multiplied by 2 gives 2x²y = 2*(-2) = -4.
So 2yz - 2x²y = (-4) - (-4) = 0.

So the k-component is 0.

Wait, so putting it all together, the curl at (1, -2, 1) is (4, 0, 0). Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

D: (4, 0, 0)
That's option D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any signs. Let me go through each component again.

i-component: ∂a_z/∂y - ∂a_y/∂z = 0 - (2xy) = -2xy. At (1, -2), that's -2*1*(-2) = 4. Correct.

j-component: ∂a_x/∂z - ∂a_z/∂x = 0 - 0 = 0. Correct.

k-component: ∂a_y/∂x - ∂a_x/∂y = 2yz - 2x²y. Plugging in: 2*(1)*(-2) = -4, and 2*(1)^2*(-2) = -4. So -4 - (-4) = 0. Correct.

So the curl is (4, 0, 0), which is option D.

The curl of the vector field \( \mathbf{a} = x^2y^2\mathbf{i} + 2xyz\mathbf{j} + z^2\mathbf{k} \) at the point (1, -2, 1) is calculated using the curl formula:

\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{a} = \left( \frac{\partial a_z}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial a_y}{\partial z} \right)\mathbf{i} + \left( \frac{\partial a_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial a_z}{\partial x} \right)\mathbf{j} + \left( \frac{\partial a_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial a_x}{\partial y} \right)\mathbf{k}
\]

1. **i-component**:  
   \[
   \frac{\partial a_z}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial a_y}{\partial z} = 0 - 2xy = -2xy
   \]  
   At (1, -2, 1):  
   \[
   -2(1)(-2) = 4
   \]

2. **j-component**:  
   \[
   \frac{\partial a_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial a_z}{\partial x} = 0 - 0 = 0
   \]

3. **k-component**:  
   \[
   \frac{\partial a_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial a_x}{\partial y} = 2yz - 2x^2y
   \]  
   At (1, -2, 1):  
   \[
   2(1)(-2) - 2(1)^2(-2) = -4 - (-4) = 0
   \]

Thus, the curl at (1, -2, 1) is \( (4, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to option D.

D: (4, 0, 0)
