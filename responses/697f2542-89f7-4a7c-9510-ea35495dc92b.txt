Okay, so I have this question about a famous line from the existentialist play 'No Exit' by Jean-Paul Sartre. The question is asking what hell is according to that play. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that 'No Exit' is a play where three characters are stuck in a room together, and through their interactions, themes of existentialism are explored. Sartre's idea in the play is that hell is indeed other people. That line is pretty famous: "Hell is other people." So the main idea is that the presence of others, and their judgment or scrutiny, can make existence unbearable.

Let me go through the options to see which one matches. Option A is a place of fire and brimstoneâ€”that's more traditional hell imagery, like from Christian theology, but not what Sartre is saying. Option B talks about colors green and blue; that doesn't ring a bell. Option C is a state of mind, which is close, but I think the play is more about the external presence of others rather than just a mental state. Option D is endless suffering, which is a broader concept and could apply, but the specific line refers to people. Option E is other people, which directly matches the famous line. Option F is eternal loneliness, which is related but focuses on being alone, whereas the play emphasizes the torment of others watching you. Option G, little made, doesn't make much sense in this context. Option H is a world without freedom, which is an existentialist concept, but again, the specific line is about others. Option I is an empty room, which isn't the case since the room is where the characters are together. Option J is oneself, which is part of the idea since Sartre also talks about self-consciousness, but the line specifically mentions others.

So the correct answer should be E: other people because that's the direct quote from the play.

The correct answer is E: other people, as the famous line from 'No Exit' states that hell is indeed other people.

Answer: E
