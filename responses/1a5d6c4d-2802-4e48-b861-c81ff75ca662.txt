(~A ∨ ~B) ⊃ C

Options:

C: Emily will stop working only if Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft.
D: Emily stopping working is a sufficient condition for either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft.
E: Unless Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Izzy plays Minecraft, Emily will stop working.
F: If Emily stops working, then neither Marina is reading a Percy Jackson book nor Izzy is playing Minecraft.
G: Either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft entails that Emily stops working.

Alright, let's tackle this logic problem. So, the question is about translating a propositional logic formula into an English sentence using the given options. The formula is (~A ∨ ~B) ⊃ C. 

First, I need to understand what each symbol represents. From the key provided:

A: Marina reads a Percy Jackson book.
B: Izzy plays Minecraft.
C: Emily stops working.

So, the formula is (~A ∨ ~B) ⊃ C. Breaking this down, the antecedent is ~A ∨ ~B, and the consequent is C. 

In logic, an implication (⊃) can be read as "If... then...". So, the structure is "If (not A or not B), then C." 

Wait, but "not A or not B" is the same as "Either Marina doesn't read the book, or Izzy isn't playing Minecraft." So the antecedent is that at least one of these is true. 

Now, the consequent is C, which is "Emily stops working." So the implication is that if either Marina isn't reading the book or Izzy isn't playing Minecraft, then Emily will stop working.

Looking at the options:

Option A says, "If Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft, then Emily will stop working." Hmm, that uses "and" instead of "or." Wait, the formula is ~A ∨ ~B, which is inclusive or, meaning either one could be true. So option A is using "and," which changes the meaning. So A is incorrect.

Option B: "If Emily stops working, then either Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book, or Izzy doesn't play Minecraft." That's the converse of the original statement. The original is (~A ∨ ~B) ⊃ C, so B is C ⊃ (~A ∨ ~B), which is the converse and not what we have. So B is out.

Option C: "Emily will stop working only if Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft." "Only if" can be tricky. In logic, "P only if Q" translates to P ⊃ Q. So here, C is saying C only if (~A ∧ ~B), which would be C ⊃ (~A ∧ ~B). That's not the same as our formula, which is (~A ∨ ~B) ⊃ C. So C is incorrect.

Option D: "Emily stopping working is a sufficient condition for either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft." Wait, sufficient condition is the antecedent. So if D is saying that Emily stopping is sufficient for (~A ∨ ~B), that would be C ⊃ (~A ∨ ~B), which again is the converse. Not what we have. So D is incorrect.

Option E: "Unless Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Izzy plays Minecraft, Emily will stop working." "Unless" is a tricky one. In logic, "Unless P, Q" translates to (P ∨ Q). Wait, no, wait. "Unless P, Q" is equivalent to Q unless P, which is the same as ~P ⊃ Q, or equivalently P ∨ Q. So E is saying that unless either A or B happens, C occurs. Which is the same as (~A ∧ ~B) ⊃ C, which is the same as our formula because (~A ∨ ~B) is equivalent to ~A ∧ ~B in implication. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, let me think again. The original formula is (~A ∨ ~B) ⊃ C, which is equivalent to (A ∧ B) ⊃ C. Because in logic, ~A ∨ ~B is the same as the contrapositive of A ⊃ B. Wait, no, not exactly. Let me clarify. 

The formula is (¬A ∨ ¬B) → C. The contrapositive of this would be ¬C → (A ∧ B). But the formula itself is (¬A ∨ ¬B) → C. Now, "unless" statements: "Unless P, Q" is equivalent to Q unless P, which is ¬P → Q, so P ∨ Q. But our formula is (¬A ∨ ¬B) → C, which can be read as "If not A or not B, then C." Alternatively, "C unless both A and B are true." Wait, no, because ¬A ∨ ¬B is the same as ¬(A ∧ B). So (¬A ∨ ¬B) → C is equivalent to (A ∧ B) → C. So that would be "If both A and B are true, then C." Alternatively, "Unless both A and B are true, C happens." So E says, "Unless Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Izzy plays Minecraft, Emily will stop working." Wait, that's "Unless (A or B), C." Which is equivalent to (A ∨ B) → C, which is not the same as our formula. Because our formula is (¬A ∨ ¬B) → C, which is equivalent to (A ∧ B) → C. So E is not correct.

Option F: "If Emily stops working, then neither Marina is reading a Percy Jackson book nor Izzy is playing Minecraft." That's C → (¬A ∧ ¬B). Again, this is the converse, so F is incorrect.

Option G: "Either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft entails that Emily stops working." "Entails" here suggests that the antecedent implies the consequent. So (~A ∨ ~B) entails C, which is exactly our formula. So G seems correct.

Option H: "If Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily won't stop working." That would translate to (A ∨ B) → ¬C. Which is the inverse of our original formula, so H is incorrect.

Option I: "If neither Marina reads a Percy Jackson book nor Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily stops working." That's (¬A ∧ ¬B) → C. Wait, but our formula is (¬A ∨ ¬B) → C. So I is a stronger statement because it requires both ¬A and ¬B to trigger C, whereas our formula only requires at least one of them. So I is incorrect.

Wait, but let me double-check. Our formula is (¬A ∨ ¬B) → C. That's equivalent to (A ∧ B) → C, which can be read as "If both Marina reads and Izzy plays, then Emily stops working." Alternatively, "Emily stops working unless both are happening." But looking at the options, G says "Either Marina not reading... or Izzy not playing... entails that Emily stops working." So the way G is phrased, if either of those happens, then Emily stops. Which matches our formula.

Wait, but I thought earlier that E was incorrect because it used "or" instead of "and." Let me check E again. E says, "Unless Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Izzy plays Minecraft, Emily will stop working." Which translates to ¬(A ∨ B) → C, because "unless P, Q" is equivalent to ¬P → Q. So if P is (A ∨ B), then ¬P is ¬A ∧ ¬B. So E is saying that if neither A nor B is true, then C happens. Which is (¬A ∧ ¬B) → C, which is the same as option I. So E is actually equivalent to I, which is not the same as our formula.

So the correct translation is G: Either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft entails that Emily stops working.

The formula (~A ∨ ~B) ⊃ C translates to "If either Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book or Izzy doesn't play Minecraft, then Emily stops working." This matches option G, which states that either condition (~A or ~B) entails that Emily stops working.

Answer: G
