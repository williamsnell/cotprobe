Okay, so I need to figure out what collective security means from the given options. Let me start by recalling what I know about collective security. From what I remember, collective security is a concept where multiple nations come together to ensure mutual safety and protection against threats. It's often associated with international organizations like the United Nations.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one to see which fits best. Option A says it's a mutual defense pact among nations. That sounds close because collective security does involve agreements where countries agree to defend each other. But I'm not sure if it's just a mutual defense pact or something broader.

Option B talks about a nation defending itself without outside help. That seems more like self-defense, not collective because it's about not involving others. So B is probably not the right answer.

Option C mentions authorization of armed force by the UN Security Council. I know the UN often handles security issues through the Security Council, but is that exactly collective security? Or is it just one aspect of it? Maybe, but I need to think more.

Option D is about humanitarian missions. Those are actions taken for humanitarian reasons, not necessarily for security among nations, so probably not D.

Option E says the right of allies to defend a victim state. This seems related but maybe a bit narrow. It's about allies stepping in, which is part of collective security, but is that the whole definition?

Option F is about sanctions authorized by the UN. Sanctions are a tool used for various reasons, including security, but again, is this the essence of collective security?

Option G refers to the right to self-defense by more than one nation acting together. This sounds similar to A but phrased differently. It emphasizes multiple nations acting in concert for self-defense, which aligns with collective security.

Option H suggests a nation invading another for its own security. That sounds more like aggressive unilateral action, not collective security, so H is likely incorrect.

Option I is about peacekeeping missions authorized by the General Assembly. Peacekeeping is a UN function, but it's a specific type of mission, not the broader concept of collective security.

Option J proposes a global police force by the UN. That's a more extreme idea and doesn't fit the typical notion of collective security, which is about mutual defense and cooperation, not a single enforcement body.

So, going back, collective security is about nations working together to ensure their common security. Option A talks about a mutual defense pact, which is a key component. Option G also seems relevant because it mentions multiple nations acting together for self-defense. But which one is more accurate?

Wait, the term collective security isn't just about mutual defense pacts. It's a broader principle where the security of each nation is seen as the concern of all. So perhaps it's more about the right of multiple nations to defend each other, which would align with G. Because mutual defense pacts (A) are a specific tool, while collective security is a principle that can encompass various measures, including defense pacts, sanctions, and more.

But looking at the options, G says "the right to self-defense by more than one nation acting in concert." That seems to encapsulate the idea better than A, which is more about the establishment of a pact. So maybe G is the better answer.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up collective security with collective defense. Collective defense is about mutual defense pacts like NATO, whereas collective security is a broader concept where the international community acts to maintain security, which can include the UN Security Council authorizing actions.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is about the UN authorizing armed force, which is part of how collective security is implemented. But is that the definition of collective security itself?

No, collective security is the principle, and the authorization by the UN is a mechanism to implement it. So the question is asking for the meaning, not the mechanism.

So, thinking again, the correct answer should be A: mutual defense pacts. But I'm a bit confused because I thought it was broader. Alternatively, perhaps G is correct because it's about multiple nations acting together for self-defense, which is the essence.

Wait, perhaps the definition is that collective security refers to the concept where each state's security is considered the responsibility of all, leading to mutual defense arrangements. So option A is more about the establishment of such pacts, while G is about the right in action.

I think the correct answer is A, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe G is better because it directly mentions multiple nations acting together for self-defense, which is the core idea.

The concept of collective security involves nations working together to ensure mutual safety and protection against threats. Among the options, A describes a mutual defense pact, which is a key tool used in collective security. However, the broader principle of collective security encompasses more than just pacts; it involves the idea that the security of each nation is a shared responsibility. Option G, which emphasizes the right of multiple nations to act together in self-defense, better captures the essence of collective security by highlighting the collaborative aspect of defense. Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

G
