Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The government increases both government spending and taxes by the same amount to keep a balanced budget. The MPC is 0.75. I need to figure out the policy direction, the expenditure multiplier, and the tax multiplier.

Hmm, right. So first, what's a balanced budget increase? Usually, when the government increases spending, that's expansionary because it puts more money into the economy. But if they also increase taxes, that's a contractionary move because higher taxes take money out of people's pockets, reducing their disposable income.

Wait, but the question says they're doing both by the same amount. So, the net effect on the budget is balanced, but what about the overall impact on the economy? I remember that government spending is expansionary, and taxes are contractionary. But since they're equal, maybe the policy is neutral? Or does the multiplier effect change that?

Wait, no, the policy direction isn't just about the budget balance but the overall effect on aggregate demand. So, increasing spending is expansionary, but increasing taxes is contractionary. But since they're equal, does that mean the policy is neutral? Or maybe it's still expansionary or contractionary because the multipliers differ.

Wait, no. The policy direction is about whether the government is trying to expand or contract the economy. If they increase both spending and taxes equally, the direct effect is that spending goes up (good for economy) and taxes go up (bad). But the key is the overall impact. But wait, the question is about the policy direction, so is it contractionary, expansionary, or neutral?

Wait, but the question says "policy direction". So, if the government is increasing both, but the net effect is balanced, but the multipliers might make it expansionary or contractionary. Because the multipliers for spending and taxes are different.

So, the expenditure multiplier is higher than the tax multiplier in absolute terms, right? Because when the government spends, it's a direct injection, and through the MPC, it's multiplied. But when taxes increase, it's a withdrawal, and the tax multiplier is negative but based on MPC.

Let me think. The formula for the expenditure multiplier is 1/(1-MPC). MPC is 0.75, so 1/(1-0.75) = 1/0.25 = 4. So the expenditure multiplier is 4.

The tax multiplier is MPC/(1-MPC). Wait, no, actually, the tax multiplier is -MPC/(1-MPC). Because when taxes increase by ΔT, the disposable income decreases by ΔT, leading to a decrease in consumption by MPC*ΔT, so the total effect is -MPC/(1-MPC) times ΔT. So with MPC 0.75, it's -0.75/(1-0.75) = -0.75/0.25 = -3.

So the tax multiplier is -3.

Now, the government increased both spending and taxes by the same amount, say Δ. So the total effect on aggregate demand is (expenditure multiplier * Δ) + (tax multiplier * Δ). That would be (4Δ) + (-3Δ) = +Δ. So the overall effect is positive, which is expansionary.

Wait, but wait. Since the government is increasing both, the net effect on the economy is positive because the expansionary effect of spending is stronger than the contractionary effect of taxes. So the policy is expansionary.

So the policy direction is expansionary, the expenditure multiplier is 4, and the tax multiplier is -3.

Looking at the options, option I says expansionary, 4, -3. Option I is "I: expansionary    4    -3".

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: contractionary 4 -3

B: expansionary 4 3

C: expansionary 3 -2

D: contractionary 5 -3

E: contractionary 3 -2

F: expansionary 5 -3

G: contractionary 4 3

H: expansionary 5 -4

I: expansionary 4 -3

J: contractionary 5 -4

So option I matches: expansionary, 4, -3.

Wait, but I thought the policy direction was expansionary because the net effect is positive. So yes, option I is correct.
</think>

The government increases both spending and taxes by the same amount, keeping the budget balanced. The MPC is 0.75. The expenditure multiplier is calculated as \( \frac{1}{1 - \text{MPC}} = 4 \), and the tax multiplier is \( -\frac{\text{MPC}}{1 - \text{MPC}} = -3 \). The overall effect on aggregate demand is \( (4 \Delta) + (-3 \Delta) = +\Delta \), which is expansionary. Therefore, the policy direction is expansionary, with an expenditure multiplier of 4 and a tax multiplier of -3.
