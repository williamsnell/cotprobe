Alright, so I've got this question here about Elise trying to remember a phone number. Let me break it down step by step. 

First, the scenario: Elise is driving to school and hears about a concert ticket giveaway on the radio. She needs to be the seventh caller to win, so she pulls over to call. Before she does, she repeats the number to herself several times. The question is asking which memory technique she's using.

Okay, the options are A through J, each a different memory concept. Let me remember what each term means.

Maintenance rehearsal is about keeping information in short-term memory by repeating it. That sounds relevant because she's repeating the number to remember it.

Chunking is breaking info into smaller parts, like how phone numbers are usually chunked into groups. But she's not necessarily doing that; she's just repeating the whole number.

Long-term memory is where info is stored permanently, but she's trying to remember it right now, so probably not LTM.

Iconic memory is visual, like seeing something and retaining the image. She's hearing the number, so maybe not this.

Elaborative rehearsal involves linking new info to what you already know. She's just repeating, not linking to other info.

Selective attention is about focusing on certain things while ignoring others. Not directly related to remembering the number.

Procedural memory is about how to do things, like riding a bike. Not relevant here.

Episodic memory is about personal experiences. She's not recalling an event, just a number.

Echoic memory is the auditory version of iconic memory, retaining sounds. She's hearing the number and possibly using this, but the question is about how she's remembering it by repeating.

Semantic memory is about facts and general knowledge, not directly applicable here.

So, putting it together. She's repeating the number to keep it in her short-term memory, which is maintenance rehearsal. So the answer should be A.
