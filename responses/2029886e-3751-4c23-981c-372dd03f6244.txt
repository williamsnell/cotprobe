Okay, so I need to find the value of the function f(x) when x is -2. The function given is f(x) = 8x³ - 6x² - 4x + 5. Hmm, let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I don't make any mistakes.

First, I'll write down the function again to have it clear in my mind: f(x) = 8x³ minus 6x² minus 4x plus 5. I need to substitute x with -2. So, I'll replace every x in the equation with (-2).

Let me start by calculating each term separately. That way, I can keep track of everything without getting confused.

The first term is 8x³. So, plugging in x = -2, that becomes 8*(-2)³. I remember that when you cube a negative number, the result is negative. So (-2)³ is (-2)*(-2)*(-2). Let's compute that: (-2)*(-2) is 4, and then 4*(-2) is -8. So the first term is 8*(-8). Multiplying that out, 8*-8 is -64.

Next, the second term is -6x². Plugging in x = -2, it becomes -6*(-2)². Wait, I need to remember the order of operations here. The square comes before the multiplication. So (-2) squared is (-2)*(-2), which is 4. So now I have -6*4. That equals -24.

Third term is -4x. Substituting x = -2, that becomes -4*(-2). Multiplying those together, -4*-2 is 8.

The last term is +5, and that doesn't change because there's no x involved. So that's just 5.

Now, let me add all these terms together:

First term: -64

Second term: -24

Third term: +8

Fourth term: +5

So adding them up: -64 -24 is -88. Then, -88 +8 is -80. Finally, -80 +5 is -75.

Wait a second, let me check my math again because sometimes I make sign errors. Let me go through each step again more carefully.

First term: 8*(-2)^3.

(-2)^3 is (-2)*(-2)=4, then 4*(-2)=-8. So 8*(-8) is indeed -64.

Second term: -6*(-2)^2.

(-2)^2 is 4, so -6*4 is -24. That's correct.

Third term: -4*(-2) is 8. Yep.

Fourth term: 5. Correct.

Now adding all together: -64 (from first term) plus (-24) is -88. Then, -88 plus 8 is -80. Then, -80 plus 5 is -75.

Hmm, looking at the options, option I is -75. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Sometimes when I'm doing multiple operations, I might have missed a negative sign or miscalculated an exponent.

Let me re-calculate each term:

1. 8*(-2)^3:
   (-2)^3 = (-2)*(-2)*(-2) = 4*(-2) = -8.
   8*(-8) = -64. Correct.

2. -6*(-2)^2:
   (-2)^2 = 4.
   -6*4 = -24. Correct.

3. -4*(-2) = 8. Correct.

4. +5. Correct.

Adding them: -64 -24 = -88; -88 +8 = -80; -80 +5 = -75. Yes, that's right.

So the answer is I: -75.

The value of \( f(-2) \) is calculated by substituting \( x = -2 \) into each term of the function \( f(x) = 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 5 \) and summing the results. After careful computation, the result is \(-75\).
