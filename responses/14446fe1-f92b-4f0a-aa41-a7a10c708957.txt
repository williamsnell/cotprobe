Alright, so I've got this question here about a male athlete's oxygen consumption and how that relates to his energy expenditure during training. Let me try to break this down step by step because I'm not entirely sure about the exact calculations, but I remember some stuff from my biology classes.

Okay, the question says the mean rate of oxygen consumption is 2 liters per minute. I think the key here is to relate oxygen consumption to energy expenditure. I remember that the body uses oxygen in the process of breaking down food for energy, so there's a conversion factor involved.

Wait, isn't there something called the "oxygen cost" of energy? I think the basic idea is that each liter of oxygen consumed corresponds to a certain amount of energy used. I'm pretty sure the conversion factor is around 5 or 20 kJ per liter. Let me think. Oh right, I think it's 20.9 kJ per liter of oxygen. So each liter of O2 used equates to roughly 20.9 kilojoules of energy.

So if the athlete is consuming 2 liters per minute, I can multiply that by 20.9 to get the energy expenditure. Let's do the math: 2 * 20.9 equals 41.8 kJ per minute. Hmm, that's approximately 42 kJ/min. Now looking at the options, I see option D is 40 kJ/min and option J is 120, which is way higher. So 40 is the closest to my calculation of 41.8.

Wait, but sometimes I've heard that the conversion is 5 kJ per liter. If that were the case, 2 liters would be 10 kJ, but that's not one of the options. So I must be confusing different contexts. Maybe 5 kJ is for a different unit, like per minute or something else? No, I think the standard is 20.9 kJ per liter because that's the caloric equivalent based on ATP production.

Another thing I recall is that the body doesn't use oxygen perfectly efficiently, but for these kinds of calculations, we usually use that 20.9 kJ per liter figure without considering losses. So sticking with that, 2 liters would be about 41.8, which rounds to 40 kJ/min. So option D is the best fit.

I also remember that sometimes the conversion is given as 5 kcal per liter, but wait, kilocalories and kilojoules are different. Oh right, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So if it's 5 kcal per liter, that would be 5 * 4.184 ≈ 20.92 kJ per liter, which matches what I thought earlier. So the initial calculation holds.

So putting it all together, 2 liters per minute times 20.9 kJ per liter gives roughly 41.8, so the answer should be around 40 kJ, which is option D.

The mean rate of oxygen consumption is 2 liters per minute. Using the conversion factor of approximately 20.9 kJ per liter of oxygen, the energy expenditure is calculated as 2 * 20.9 ≈ 41.8 kJ/min. The closest option provided is 40 kJ/min.

Answer: D
