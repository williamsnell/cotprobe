Alright, I'm trying to figure out which of the options lists only minerals. Okay, so first, I need to remember what defines a mineral. From what I recall, minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic solids with a definite chemical composition and crystal structure. They're formed through various geological processes, and they have specific physical properties like color, luster, hardness, etc.

So, the question is asking which of the given lists includes only minerals. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Coal, chert, limestone, dolomite, halite.
Hmm, coal is a sedimentary rock made from compressed plant matter, so it's not a mineral. Chert is a type of rock, too, made of silica. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of calcium carbonate. Dolomite is a carbonate rock. Halite, on the other hand, is a mineral—commonly known as rock salt. So, since most of these are rocks, A is out.

Option B: Iron, copper, zinc, lead, granite.
Iron, copper, zinc, and lead are all metals, which are minerals. But granite is an igneous rock, not a mineral. So B has a mix and is incorrect.

Option C: Diamond, quartz, gypsum, salt, chalk.
Diamonds and quartz are minerals. Gypsum is a mineral as well. Salt is halite, definitely a mineral. Chalk is a type of limestone, which is a rock. So C has chalk, which is a rock, so it's not all minerals.

Option D: Gneiss, schist, phyllite, chlorite, mica.
Gneiss and schist are metamorphic rocks. Phyllite is also a metamorphic rock. Chlorite and mica are minerals. So D has rocks and minerals, so it's not correct.

Option E: Coal, quartz, gold, diamond, copper.
Coal is a rock. The rest—quartz, gold, diamond, copper—are all minerals. So E has one rock, so it's not all minerals.

Option F: Marble, obsidian, basalt, quartz, diamond.
Marble is a metamorphic rock. Obsidian is an igneous rock, and basalt is also an igneous rock. Quartz and diamond are minerals. So F has three rocks and two minerals; not the right choice.

Option G: Sandstone, shale, limestone, diamond, gold.
Sandstone and shale are sedimentary rocks. Limestone is a sedimentary rock. Diamond and gold are minerals. So G has three rocks and two minerals; not all minerals.

Option H: Granite, gabbro, diorite, quartz, feldspar.
Granite, gabbro, and diorite are all igneous rocks. Quartz and feldspar are minerals. So H has three rocks and two minerals; incorrect.

Option I: Gold, quartz, topaz, diamond, corundum.
Gold is a mineral. Quartz is a mineral. Topaz is a mineral as well. Diamond is a mineral. Corundum is the mineral from which rubies and sapphires are formed. So all of these are minerals. I think this is the correct option.

Option J: Granite, topaz, marble, quartz, feldspar.
Granite and marble are rocks. Topaz, quartz, and feldspar are minerals. So J has two rocks and three minerals; not all minerals.

So, after going through each option, I think option I is the only one that lists only minerals.

The correct answer is I, as it includes only minerals.

I
