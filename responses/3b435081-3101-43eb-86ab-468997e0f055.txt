Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that real GNP is expanding at a steady annual rate of 2 percent. Real GNP is the actual output of the economy, adjusted for inflation, right? So that's like the real growth part. Then, the nominal money stock is increasing at a steady annual rate of 5 percent. Nominal money is the actual money supply, like M1 or M2, without adjusting for prices.

The question is asking about the effect on the average price level, assuming the income-velocity of circulation of money is unchanged. Hmm, velocity of money is how many times a unit of money is used in transactions over a period, so if velocity is constant, that simplifies things.

I remember the quantity theory of money, which says that the money supply multiplied by velocity equals nominal GNP. The formula is M * V = P * Y, where M is money supply, V is velocity, P is price level, and Y is real GNP. 

Since velocity is unchanged, the equation simplifies. We can rearrange the equation to find the relationship between money growth and price level growth. So, if M is increasing, and V is constant, then P * Y should increase proportionally to M's increase. 

Wait, but real GNP is also growing. So real GNP (Y) is growing at 2% annually. Let me think. The nominal GNP (which is P * Y) would be affected by both the growth in money and real output.

So, let's model this. Let me denote the growth rates. The growth rate of money (M) is 5%. The growth rate of real GNP (Y) is 2%. We're looking for the growth rate of the price level (P).

From the equation M * V = P * Y, since V is constant, the growth rate of M * V is equal to the growth rate of P * Y. So, the percentage change in M plus the percentage change in V (which is zero here) equals the percentage change in P plus the percentage change in Y.

So, mathematically, it's:

ΔM + ΔV = ΔP + ΔY

But ΔV is zero because velocity is unchanged. So,

ΔM = ΔP + ΔY

We can rearrange that to solve for ΔP:

ΔP = ΔM - ΔY

We know ΔM is 5% and ΔY is 2%, so:

ΔP = 5% - 2% = 3%

Wait, but wait—does that mean the price level is increasing by 3%? Because if M is growing faster than Y, prices should go up. So, the average price level would increase by 3% annually.

Looking at the options, option I is 3 percent. So I think the answer is I.

The correct answer is I: 3 percent. 

Here's the reasoning: Using the quantity theory of money, where M * V = P * Y, and assuming V is constant, the growth rate of P (price level) can be calculated as ΔP = ΔM - ΔY. With ΔM = 5% and ΔY = 2%, ΔP = 5% - 2% = 3%. Thus, the average price level increases by 3%.
