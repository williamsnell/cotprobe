Okay, so I have this problem about X-rays scattered from rock salt, NaCl. The question says there's an intense maximum at 20 degrees, and n is 1. I need to find the wavelength of the incident radiation in nanometers. The options are from A to J, with various numbers.

Hmm, I remember something about X-ray diffraction. Oh right, it's the Bragg's Law! The formula is nλ = 2d sinθ. Right, so Bragg's Law relates the wavelength of the X-rays to the crystal structure.

Wait, rock salt is NaCl. I think the structure is face-centered cubic, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Oh yeah, the interplanar spacing d is important here. For NaCl, the unit cell is cubic, and the planes we're considering are probably the (200) or (220) planes. Wait, no, maybe it's (111)? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Rock salt has a face-centered cubic structure, so the planes are (200), (220), etc. But I think the most common planes for diffraction in NaCl are the (200) planes, or perhaps (220). Wait, no, I think the (200) planes are used because each ion is at the corners and face centers. So the d-spacing for (200) planes would be half the edge length, maybe. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the (111) planes. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think again. NaCl has a face-centered cubic structure where each ion is at the corners and face centers. So for the (200) planes, the interplanar spacing d would be a/2, where a is the lattice constant. Or wait, maybe for (111) planes, d is a/(√3). Hmm, I'm not quite confident. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the d-spacing using the known unit cell of NaCl.

I remember that the unit cell edge length for NaCl is about 5.64 Ångströms. Wait, no, that's for another crystal maybe. Wait, I think NaCl has a lattice parameter a ≈ 5.64 Å, but I'm not certain. Let me proceed with that assumption for now.

So if the planes are (200), then d = a/2. So with a = 5.64 Å, d would be 5.64 / 2 = 2.82 Å. Alternatively, if it's (111), d would be a/(√3) ≈ 5.64 / 1.732 ≈ 3.257 Å. Hmm, but which plane is it? The problem mentions an intense maximum, so perhaps it's the first-order reflection, so n=1. Let's see.

Wait, in Bragg's Law, n is the order of reflection. So with n=1, the first-order reflection. The angle is given as 20 degrees. So let's plug into the formula.

But first, I need the correct d-spacing for NaCl. Maybe I should look up the typical planes used for NaCl's diffraction. Oh wait, I think that for NaCl, the strongest reflections come from the (200) planes because of the way the ions are arranged. So let's go with d = a/2.

So if a = 5.64 Å, then d = 5.64 / 2 = 2.82 Å. Now, using Bragg's Law: nλ = 2d sinθ.

Given θ is 20 degrees, n is 1. So λ = (2d sinθ)/n. Plugging in the numbers: λ = (2 * 2.82 Å * sin(20°)) / 1.

Wait, sin(20°) is approximately 0.3420. So λ ≈ 2 * 2.82 * 0.3420. Let me calculate that.

2.82 * 2 = 5.64. Then 5.64 * 0.3420 ≈ 5.64 * 0.342. Let me compute 5.64 * 0.3 is 1.692, 5.64 * 0.042 is about 0.23688. So total is approximately 1.92888 Å. But wait, wait, wait. That can't be right because the options are in the 0.075 to 1.5 nm range, and 1.92888 Å is 0.192888 nm, which is about 0.193 nm. Looking at the options, option H is 0.25, option I is 0.075, option J is 0.098. Wait, 0.193 is close to option B: 0.20 nm, but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the d-spacing. Maybe I should use a different plane. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the correct plane is (220). For the (220) planes, the interplanar spacing d is a/(2√2). So if a is 5.64 Å, then d = 5.64 / (2 * 1.4142) ≈ 5.64 / 2.8284 ≈ 1.993 Å. Then plugging into Bragg's Law: λ = (2 * 1.993 * sin(20°)) / 1.

So sin(20) is 0.3420. So 2 * 1.993 = 3.986. Multiply by 0.3420: 3.986 * 0.342 ≈ 1.363 Å, which is 0.1363 nm. Hmm, that's about 0.136 nm. Looking at the options, option C is 0.15 nm, which is close. But I'm not sure if I used the correct plane.

Wait, perhaps I should check another approach. Maybe the rock salt structure uses the (111) plane, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives a different d-spacing, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate using the given options to see which one gives a 20-degree angle with n=1.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the nearest neighbor distance as the d-spacing. But in NaCl, the nearest neighbor distance is a/2, since each ion is at the corner and face centers, so it's a face-centered cubic structure. So maybe using d = a/2, as I did earlier.

Wait, but I'm getting λ ≈ 1.92888 Å, which is 0.192888 nm. So that's approximately 0.193 nm. The options don't have that exact value. The closest is option B: 0.20 nm, but let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says the angle is 20 degrees from the incident direction. Oh wait, in Bragg's Law, the angle is measured from the normal to the crystal plane, so that's correct. Alternatively, sometimes people use 2θ as the scattering angle, but in Bragg's Law, θ is the angle from the normal.

Wait, maybe I should recheck my calculation. So 2 * d * sinθ = nλ.

If d = 2.82 Å, and sin(20) ≈ 0.3420, then 2 * 2.82 * 0.3420 = 5.64 * 0.3420 ≈ 1.928 Å. So 1.928 Å is 0.1928 nm, which is about 0.193 nm. Looking at the options, the closest is option B: 0.20 nm. But option H is 0.25, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the lattice parameter a is different. Maybe I assumed a wrong value for a. I thought a was about 5.64 Å for NaCl. Let me confirm that. I think NaCl has a lattice parameter of approximately 5.64 Å. So that's correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem is using a different plane, leading to a different d-spacing. For instance, if it's the (100) planes, then d would be a/1 = a, which is 5.64 Å. Then λ = 2 * 5.64 * sin(20°) ≈ 2 * 5.64 * 0.342 ≈ 3.89 nm, which is way too big compared to the options. So that's not it.

Alternatively, if it's the (111) planes, d = a/√3 ≈ 5.64 / 1.732 ≈ 3.257 Å. Then λ = 2 * 3.257 * 0.342 ≈ 2.223 nm, which is even bigger, so not matching any options.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recalculate using d = 2.82 Å.

So 2 * d is 5.64, multiplied by sin(20) which is 0.3420. So 5.64 * 0.3420 = let's compute this accurately.

5.64 * 0.3 = 1.692.

5.64 * 0.04 = 0.2256.

5.64 * 0.002 = 0.01128.

Adding those: 1.692 + 0.2256 = 1.9176, plus 0.01128 gives 1.92888 Å, which is 0.192888 nm, as before.

So that's approximately 0.193 nm. The options are A:0.30, B:0.20, C:0.15, D:1.00, E:0.65, F:1.50, G:0.50, H:0.25, I:0.075, J:0.098.

Looking at these, 0.193 is closest to option B: 0.20 nm, but it's about 0.007 nm off. Alternatively, perhaps I should round it to 0.20 nm.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses a different value for a. Maybe the lattice parameter is 5.64 angstroms, but perhaps I should use a more precise value, or perhaps the problem expects using 2.82 Å as d for (200) planes.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem gives that the first-order maximum is at 20 degrees, so n=1. So maybe I can compute lambda using another method.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the nearest neighbor distance as d, which is a/2. So perhaps I can proceed with that.

So, lambda = (2d sinθ)/n.

Given:

n=1,

θ=20 degrees,

d= a/2.

If a is 5.64 Å, then d=2.82 Å.

So lambda = (2 * 2.82 Å * sin(20°)) = 5.64 * 0.3420 ≈ 1.92888 Å = 0.192888 nm.

So that's approximately 0.193 nm. The nearest option is B:0.20 nm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem uses a different a value. Let me check some sources. Oh wait, I'm just recalling, NaCl has a lattice parameter of about 5.64 Å, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using a different plane, like (111), but that would give a larger d-spacing, leading to a longer wavelength, which isn't matching the options.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the angle is measured from the incident direction, which is different from the Bragg angle. Wait, Bragg's Law uses the angle from the normal, which is the same as the angle from the incident direction if the crystal is oriented correctly. Hmm, not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula: nλ = 2d sinθ. So if the angle is 20 degrees, and n=1, then λ = 2d sinθ.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute:

d = 2.82 Å,

sin(20) ≈ 0.3420,

so 2 * 2.82 = 5.64,

5.64 * 0.3420 = let's compute 5.64 * 0.3 = 1.692, 5.64 * 0.042 = 0.23688,

Adding: 1.692 + 0.23688 = 1.92888 Å = 0.192888 nm.

Hmm, so that's approximately 0.193 nm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:0.20 nm. But perhaps the problem expects rounding to two decimal places, so 0.193 would be 0.19 nm, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider using a more precise value for sin(20°). Let me use a calculator for sin(20°).

Wait, sin(20°) is approximately 0.3420201433.

So 5.64 * 0.3420201433 = let's compute that precisely:

5 * 0.3420201433 = 1.7101007165,

0.64 * 0.3420201433 ≈ 0.219.

Adding: 1.7101 + 0.219 = 1.9291 Å, which is 0.19291 nm, approximately 0.193 nm.

So the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the wavelength is approximately 0.193 nm, which isn't exactly one of the options, but the closest is option B:0.20 nm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the d-spacing.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the (220) planes. So d = a/(2√2) = 5.64/(2*1.4142) ≈ 5.64/2.8284 ≈ 1.993 Å.

Then lambda = 2 * d * sinθ = 2 * 1.993 * 0.3420 ≈ 3.986 * 0.3420 ≈ 1.362 Å = 0.1362 nm.

Looking at the options, that's close to option C:0.15 nm. But 0.136 is closer to 0.14 nm, which isn't an option. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the strongest reflection in NaCl is from the (200) planes, so using d=2.82 Å. So my initial calculation stands.

Wait, but the options don't have 0.193. The options are A:0.30, B:0.20, C:0.15, etc. So perhaps I need to recheck the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So, perhaps the intended answer is B:0.20 nm.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the value of 0.193 nm and rounds it to 0.20 nm. So I think option B is the intended answer.

To solve the problem, we use Bragg's Law: 

\[
n\lambda = 2d\sin\theta
\]

Given:
- \( n = 1 \)
- \( \theta = 20^\circ \)
- Rock salt (NaCl) has a face-centered cubic structure. The interplanar spacing \( d \) for the (200) planes is \( d = \frac{a}{2} \), where \( a \) is the lattice constant of NaCl (\( a \approx 5.64 \, \text{Å} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate \( d \)
\[
d = \frac{a}{2} = \frac{5.64}{2} = 2.82 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 2: Use Bragg's Law to find \( \lambda \)
\[
\lambda = \frac{2d\sin\theta}{n}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\lambda = \frac{2 \cdot 2.82 \cdot \sin(20^\circ)}{1}
\]
\[
\sin(20^\circ) \approx 0.3420
\]
\[
\lambda = 2 \cdot 2.82 \cdot 0.3420 = 5.64 \cdot 0.3420 \approx 1.92888 \, \text{Å} = 0.192888 \, \text{nm}
\]

### Step 3: Compare with options
The calculated wavelength is approximately \( 0.193 \, \text{nm} \). Among the given options, the closest value is **B: 0.20 nm**.

### Conclusion
The wavelength of the incident radiation is approximately \( 0.20 \, \text{nm} \).
