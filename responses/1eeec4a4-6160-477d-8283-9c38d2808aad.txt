Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether extra-territorial abduction is a ground for English courts to refuse jurisdiction even if it's otherwise lawful. The options are A through D. 

First, I need to understand what extra-territorial abduction means. From what I remember, it refers to the forcible removal of a person from one country to another, usually by a government or some authority, without the legal processes of the country where the person is taken from.

The question is specifically about English courts and whether they would refuse jurisdiction in such cases. So, I'm thinking about how English law handles cases where a defendant has been abducted from another country. 

I recall something about the doctrine of "forum non conveniens," which is when a court might decline jurisdiction on the grounds that another forum is more appropriate. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, there might be principles related to abuse of process.

Looking at the options:

Option A says that such abduction is abuse of process and leads to a stay of proceedings. I think that if the court finds that the defendant was abducted in a way that's against legal process, they might stop the proceedings. But I'm not certain if this is the case in English law.

Option B suggests that the abductor is liable but doesn't stop the proceedings. So maybe even if someone abducted someone, the court would still proceed. I'm not sure if the court's jurisdiction would be affected by the abductor's liability.

Option C claims that a stay would prevent justice for international criminals. This sounds like a policy argument against staying proceedings. Maybe courts don't want to let criminals off just because they were abducted, but I'm not sure how this applies here.

Option D states that courts may, but will seldom, stay proceedings in such cases. This seems more moderate. It suggests that while the court has the discretion, it's not something they do often.

I think English courts do consider whether a defendant was abducted when deciding on jurisdiction. If a person was brought to England through abduction, the court might question the fairness of proceeding. But I also remember that in some cases, the court might proceed if it's in the interests of justice, especially if the allegations are serious.

In the case of R v. Bow Street Magistrates ex parte Pinochet (1996), the court discussed the issue of a former head of state being extradited. It mentioned the principle that a state cannot claim immunity for certain heinous crimes. But that's more about extradition than jurisdiction.

Another point is the European Convention on Human Rights, which might require courts to consider the fairness of trials. If a defendant was abducted, it could raise issues of a fair trial, leading the court to stay proceedings.

However, I also remember that courts are reluctant to stay cases unless there's a strong reason. So maybe they don't always do it, but they can.

Looking back at the options, option D says they may, but will seldom, stay the proceedings. That seems plausible because courts don't want to undermine the rule of law by letting serious cases be dismissed on procedural grounds. But if the abduction is proven, they might have to consider it.

Option A's idea of abuse of process leading to a stay might be correct in some cases, but I'm not sure if it's the primary consideration. It could be a factor, but the more nuanced approach is what the law usually takes.

So, putting it all together, I think the answer is D because English courts have the discretion to stay proceedings in cases of extra-territorial abduction, but they don't do it often. It's a balance between justice and the procedural fairness of the defendant's presence.

The question concerns whether extra-territorial abduction constitutes a ground for English courts to refuse jurisdiction in otherwise lawful cases. After considering the options, the analysis suggests that while English courts may have the discretion to stay proceedings in such cases, they do so rarely, balancing justice and procedural fairness. 

Answer: D
