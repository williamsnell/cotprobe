Question:

Differentiate tariffs from quotas as barriers to free trade.

Options:

A: Tariffs and quotas both set a maximum limit on imports
B: Tariffs are regulatory fees on exports, while quotas are subsidies for imported goods
C: Tariffs limit the quantity of goods, and quotas impose taxes on imports
D: Quotas are taxes on goods, and tariffs limit the quantity of imports
E: Tariffs are preferential trade agreements between countries, while quotas are unilateral restrictions imposed by one country on another's exports
F: Quotas require domestic producers to limit production, while tariffs are used to standardize the price of imports and exports
G: Quotas are fixed fees on the volume of imports, and tariffs are percentage-based restrictions on the quantity of imports
H: Tariffs are used to ban specific goods from being imported, while quotas require a special license to import more than a certain amount
I: Tariffs are taxes on imported goods to raise revenue and protect domestic industries, while quotas set a maximum on the quantity of a good that may be imported during a given time period.
J: Quotas increase the price of domestic goods, while tariffs restrict the amount of goods leaving the country

Okay, so I have this question about tariffs and quotas as barriers to free trade. I need to differentiate between them. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that both tariffs and quotas are types of trade barriers, but they work differently. Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. So when a country imposes a tariff, it's adding a tax to the goods coming in, which effectively increases their price. This makes imported goods more expensive, which can protect domestic industries because their products become relatively cheaper. Tariffs can also be a source of revenue for the government.

Quotas, on the other hand, are limits on the quantity of a particular good that can be imported. So instead of a tax, quotas set a maximum amount that can be imported within a certain period. Once that quota is reached, further imports are restricted or even banned. This also protects domestic industries by limiting the supply of foreign goods, which can drive up their prices and make domestic products more attractive.

Looking at the options:

Option A says both set a maximum limit on imports. Hmm, tariffs don't set a limit; they impose taxes. So A is incorrect.

Option B claims tariffs are on exports, which I think is wrong because tariffs are on imports. So B is probably not right.

Option C says tariffs limit quantity and quotas impose taxes. No, that's the opposite. Tariffs are taxes, quotas are limits on quantity. So C is wrong.

Option D says quotas are taxes and tariffs limit quantity. Again, that's reversed. So D is incorrect.

Option E talks about preferential agreements and unilateral restrictions. I'm not sure, but tariffs are more about taxes, not preferential agreements, so E might not be right.

Option F mentions quotas requiring domestic production limits and tariffs standardizing prices. I don't think that's accurate. Quotas don't directly affect domestic production, and tariffs affect prices by adding a tax, not standardizing them.

Option G says quotas are fixed fees on volume, and tariffs are percentage-based quantity restrictions. Wait, no. Tariffs are taxes, usually a percentage of the value. Quotas are about quantity, not a fee. So G is mixing things up.

Option H says tariffs ban goods, and quotas require a license. Partially true, but tariffs don't ban, they just tax. Quotas can lead to bans once the limit is reached, but this option doesn't capture the essence correctly.

Option I states tariffs are taxes to raise revenue and protect industries, while quotas set a maximum on quantity. That sounds correct because tariffs are taxes and quotas limit the amount imported.

Option J says quotas increase domestic prices and tariffs restrict exports. No, tariffs affect imports, not exports, and quotas don't necessarily increase domestic prices; they restrict imports which can affect prices, but J's description is off.

So the correct answer should be I.

The correct answer is I because it accurately describes tariffs as taxes on imports meant to raise revenue and protect domestic industries, while quotas set a maximum on the quantity of goods that can be imported.
