Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this question about choosing the right driving chain for a motor setup. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, I need to understand the problem. The motor is 7 hp, runs at 500 rpm, and it's driving an engine that needs to run at 300 rpm. The center distance is 30 inches. The driving sprocket has 20 teeth, and the driven one has 30 teeth. I need to pick the appropriate chain from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that when selecting a chain, factors like speed, horsepower, and the number of teeth come into play. Also, the chain's pitch, the number of strands, and the length are important. Let me think about each part.

First, the speed ratio. The motor is running at 500 rpm, and the engine needs 300 rpm. So the ratio is 500:300, which simplifies to 5:3. Wait, no, actually, the ratio is output speed over input speed. So 300/500 = 0.6. That means the driven sprocket is smaller in ratio, but since it has more teeth, maybe that's okay. Wait, no, the number of teeth on the sprocket affects the speed ratio. The formula is N1/N2 = T2/T1. So N1 is 500, N2 is 300. T1 is 20, T2 is 30. Let's check: 500/300 = 30/20 → 5/3 ≈1.666. Yeah, that's correct. So the speed ratio is correct with those sprocket sizes.

Now, the next step is probably calculating the required chain speed. The chain's linear speed can be found using the motor's rpm and the sprocket teeth. The formula is V = π * D * N, but since we're dealing with sprockets, it's V = (π * T * N) / 60, where T is the number of teeth on the driving sprocket and N is rpm. Wait, no, more accurately, the pitch is involved. The chain pitch is the distance between two consecutive links. So the chain speed is (π * D * N)/60, but D is the diameter of the sprocket, which is based on the number of teeth and the pitch. Alternatively, since the pitch is the same for both sprockets, the linear speed can be calculated as V = (π * T1 * N1) / 60. Or wait, another way: the chain's linear speed is the same for both sprockets, so V = (π * T1 * N1) / 60 = (π * T2 * N2) / 60. Let me plug in the numbers: T1=20, N1=500. So V = (π * 20 * 500)/60. Let me compute that. 20*500=10,000. 10,000/60 ≈166.666. Multiply by π (approx 3.1416) gives 166.666 *3.1416 ≈523.6 in/min. So the chain speed is about 523.6 inches per minute.

Next, I think I need to determine the required chain length. The center distance is 30 inches. The chain length can be approximated using the formula: L = (π * (C + 2S)) + 2C, where C is the center distance and S is the sum of the sprocket teeth divided by 2. Wait, no, maybe a better formula is L = (C * 2) + (T1 + T2) * (π * C) / (2 * (T1 + T2)))). Hmm, I might be mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, the length can be calculated using the formula for the circumference of the sprocket circles plus twice the center distance. But perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the length of the chain: L = (C * (T1 + T2)) / (2 * (T1 - T2)) ) + ... Wait, maybe I should look for the standard formula.

Wait, I think the standard formula for chain length is: L = (C * (T1 + T2)) / (2 * (T1 - T2)) ) + ... Hmm, no, perhaps I'm confusing it with something else. Alternatively, the length can be approximated as L ≈ (C * 2) + (T1 + T2) * (π * C) / (2 * (T1 + T2)))... No, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the circumference of the sprocket circle plus twice the center distance times (1 + (T1 + T2)/(2*(T1 - T2)))... Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach: the chain length can be calculated using the formula L = (C * (T1 + T2)) / (2 * (T1 - T2)) ) + (C * (T1 - T2)) / (2 * (T1 + T2)) ). Or perhaps I should use the formula for the length of a chain wrapped around two sprockets, which is L = (C * (T1 + T2) ) / (2 * (T1 - T2)) ) + (C * (T1 - T2) ) / (2 * (T1 + T2)) ) + 2 * C. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a simplified way.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the number of chain links. The chain length in inches is roughly (C * (T1 + T2)) / (2 * (T1 - T2)) ) + (C * (T1 - T2)) / (2 * (T1 + T2)) ) + 2 * C. But I'm not confident. Maybe I should instead calculate the number of teeth on the chain. Wait, another approach: the number of teeth on the chain can be found by (T1 + T2) * (C / (2 * P)) ), where P is the pitch. Wait, no, perhaps that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of links. The number of links needed is approximately (C / P) * (T1 + T2) / 2 + 1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the chain length in inches can be found by L = (C * (T1 + T2)) / (2 * (T1 - T2)) ) + (C * (T1 - T2)) / (2 * (T1 + T2)) ) + 2*C. But this seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler approximation.

Wait, another approach: the length of the chain can be approximated by L ≈ (C * (T1 + T2)) / (2 * (T1 - T2)) ) + (C * (T1 - T2)) / (2 * (T1 + T2)) ) + 2*C. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula: L = (C * (T1 + T2)) / (2 * (T1 - T2)) ) + 2 * C. But I'm not confident. Maybe I should instead calculate the chain's required pitch.

Wait, perhaps I should first determine the pitch of the chain. The options given are no. 50 and no. 60 chains. No. 50 chain has a pitch of 0.5 inches, and no. 60 has a pitch of 0.625 inches. So let's note that.

The pitch (p) is the distance between two consecutive links. So for a no. 50 chain, p=0.5 inches; no. 60, p=0.625 inches.

Now, the next thing is to calculate the required number of teeth on the chain. The number of teeth on the chain (Z) is equal to the number of teeth on the driving sprocket (T1) multiplied by (N1 * 60)/(V), where V is the chain speed. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The chain's linear speed V is equal to (π * T1 * N1)/60. We already calculated V as approximately 523.6 in/min.

The number of teeth on the chain can be found by (V * 60) / (π * p), where p is the pitch. Wait, let me think: since the chain moves at V inches per minute, in one minute, it moves V inches. The number of pitches (links) that pass by is V / p. Each pitch is a link, so the number of links per minute is V / p. But each link has a certain number of teeth, depending on the sprocket. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the number of teeth on the chain (Z) can be calculated as Z = (V * 60) / (π * p). Because V is in inches per minute, and π*p is the circumference per revolution. So Z would be the number of teeth per minute, which is the same as the number of teeth per revolution multiplied by rpm.

Wait, let me clarify. The chain's linear speed is V inches per minute. The number of revolutions per minute (rpm) of the chain is V / (π * D), where D is the diameter of the chain's circle. But since the chain is wrapped around sprockets, the effective diameter is based on the sprocket teeth. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the number of teeth on the chain can be found by Z = (N1 * T1 * 60) / (V). Wait, no, perhaps I should use the formula Z = (N1 * T1) / (V). Not sure. Maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of links needed based on the chain length.

Wait, let's try calculating the chain length first. The formula for the length of a chain between two sprockets is approximately L = (C * (T1 + T2)) / (2 * (T1 - T2)) ) + (C * (T1 - T2)) / (2 * (T1 + T2)) ) + 2*C. But I'm not confident. Maybe I should use a standard approximation.

Alternatively, I can use the formula L = C * (T1 + T2) / (2 * (T1 - T2)) ) + C. Let me try that. Plugging in T1=20, T2=30. So T1+T2=50, T1-T2=-10. Wait, but that would make the denominator negative, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, the formula should consider the absolute difference. Maybe it's L = C * (T1 + T2) / (2 * (T2 - T1)) ) + C. Because T2 is larger than T1, since the driven sprocket is larger (30 teeth) to reduce speed. So T2-T1=10.

So L = 30 * (50) / (2 * 10) ) + 30 = (1500) / 20 +30 = 75 +30=105 inches. So the chain length is approximately 105 inches.

Now, to find the number of links, I need to know the pitch. The pitch is the distance between two consecutive links. So for a no. 50 chain, p=0.5 inches; no. 60, p=0.625 inches.

Number of links = L / p. So for no. 50: 105 / 0.5 =210 links. For no. 60: 105 /0.625=168 links.

But wait, the number of links should be even because chains are usually available in even numbers. So 210 is even, 168 is even too. Hmm.

Next, the horsepower (7 hp) is important. I think the chain's power transmission capacity should be sufficient. The formula for chain power is P = (V * F * Z * p) / 1000, where F is the tension force, Z is the number of teeth, and p is pitch. But I don't have F, so maybe I should look for a different approach.

Alternatively, there's a formula for maximum chain tension based on horsepower. The maximum tension F can be calculated using F = (P * 1000) / (V * Z). But again, without knowing Z, it's tricky. Maybe I should look for the appropriate chain size based on the required speed and load.

Wait, another approach: the chain's required tensile strength. The power transmitted by the chain can be found using P = F * V, where F is the force. So F = P / V. P is 7 hp, which is 7 * 550 = 3850 ft-lbf. Converting to lbf, it's 3850 lbf. Wait, no, 7 hp is 7 * 550 = 3850 ft-lbf per minute. So power is 3850 ft-lbf/min. To convert to watts, but maybe I can keep it in imperial units.

The chain speed V is 523.6 in/min. So F = 3850 / 523.6 ≈7.35 lbf. That seems low, but maybe I'm missing something. Wait, no, because the formula P = F * V is in the same units. Wait, F is in lbf, V in ft/min. Wait, 523.6 inches per minute is 523.6/12 ≈43.63 ft/min. So V=43.63 ft/min. Then F = 3850 /43.63 ≈88.27 lbf. That's more reasonable.

Now, the tension in the chain is about 88.27 lbf. But how does this relate to the chain's rating?

Chains have a certain tensile strength. The number of strands affects the total tension capacity. For example, a single-strand chain can handle a certain tension, but adding strands multiplies that capacity.

Looking at the options:

A: Double-strand no.50

B: Triple-strand no.50

C: Triple-strand no.60

D: Single-strand no.50

Each strand in a multi-strand chain can handle a certain amount of tension. For example, a single no.50 chain has a certain tensile strength, but a double-strand would have twice that, and triple would be three times.

I need to find the tensile strength for each option. Let me think about standard chain ratings.

Typically, for roller chains, a single no.50 chain has a tensile strength around 2,000 lbf. So a double-strand would be 4,000 lbf, and triple would be 6,000 lbf. Similarly, a no.60 chain is larger, with a tensile strength around 3,500 lbf per strand. So triple-strand no.60 would be 10,500 lbf.

Wait, but I'm not sure about exact numbers. Let me try to recall. For a single no.50 chain, the tensile strength is about 2,000 lbf. So for the required tension of ~88 lbf, even a single strand would suffice. But wait, that seems too low. Maybe I'm missing a factor. Because in reality, the chain has to handle not just the tension but also the forces during acceleration and any other dynamic loads.

Wait, but 88 lbf seems manageable even for a single-strand no.50 chain. So why are the options suggesting multi-strand chains? Perhaps I'm miscalculating the tension.

Wait, let me double-check the power calculation. 7 hp is 7 * 550 = 3850 ft-lbf/min. The chain speed is 523.6 inches per minute, which is 523.6/12 ≈43.63 ft/min. So F = 3850 /43.63 ≈88.27 lbf. That seems correct.

But maybe the formula should consider the total force, including both the driving and the driven sprocket tensions. Wait, no, because the tension in the chain is the same throughout, except for the initial acceleration. So perhaps the static tension is around 88 lbf.

If a single no.50 strand can handle 2,000 lbf, then 88 lbf is well within its capacity. So why would we need a multi-strand chain? Maybe I'm missing something else, like the chain's ability to handle the speed and the loads over time, including dynamic factors.

Alternatively, maybe the calculation is correct, and a single strand is sufficient, but considering the center distance and the chain length, the chain might need to have a certain number of links to avoid being too tight or too slack.

Wait, let's think about the chain's operating conditions. The motor is 7 hp, which isn't extremely high, but the chain needs to handle the speed and the tension without breaking or wearing out quickly.

Another factor is the chain's speed and the maximum allowable operating speed based on the chain's design. The maximum speed a chain can handle depends on its pitch and the material. A smaller pitch allows for higher speeds.

In our case, the chain speed is about 523.6 in/min, which is roughly 43.63 ft/min. For a no.50 chain (p=0.5"), the maximum speed is typically around 300 ft/min, but that's for continuous operation. Wait, but 43.63 ft/min is well within that limit. So no issue there.

Now, considering the number of teeth and the chain's strength, perhaps the number of strands isn't critical for the tension, but maybe for other factors like load distribution or the risk of chain breakage.

Wait, but the options include single, double, and triple strands. Let me consider the tensile strength again. If a single strand can handle 2,000 lbf, then a triple-strand no.50 chain would handle 6,000 lbf, which is way more than needed. But perhaps the question is more about the chain's capacity considering the power and the required speed, including any safety factors.

Wait, another angle: the horsepower transmitted by the chain. The formula for chain power is P = (V * F * Z * p) / 1000, where Z is the number of teeth in contact. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the power can be calculated as P = (T1 * N1 * T2 * N2) / (2 * π * 60^2). Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the power transmitted by the chain can be found using P = (T1 * T2) * (N1 * N2) / (2 * π * 60^2). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use P = (T1 * N1^2) / (2 * π * 60^2) * something. I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the torque. The motor's torque is (7 hp * 550 lb-ft/hp) / (500 rpm) ≈ (3850) /500 ≈7.7 lb-ft. The driven engine's torque would be (300 rpm) * T / 6000, where T is torque. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, the torque on the chain can be found using T = (F * p * Z) / 2, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should focus back on the chain selection. The key factors are the chain's pitch, the number of strands, and the length.

From earlier, the chain length is about 105 inches. For a no.50 chain (p=0.5"), number of links is 105/0.5=210. For no.60 (p=0.625"), it's 105/0.625=168.

Now, the number of strands affects the total load capacity. So for the same pitch, more strands mean higher capacity.

Given that the required tension is about 88 lbf, and assuming a single no.50 strand can handle 2,000 lbf, then even a single strand would suffice. But perhaps the question is more about the chain's speed and the number of teeth in engagement.

Wait, the number of teeth in engagement is important for load distribution. More teeth mean a smoother transmission and higher load capacity. The driving sprocket has 20 teeth, so the chain should have enough teeth to engage with that.

Wait, but the chain's number of teeth is equal to the number of sprocket teeth, right? Or is it based on the number of links? Hmm, perhaps not. The number of teeth on the chain refers to the number of teeth on the sprocket, but the chain itself is made of links that engage with the sprocket teeth.

Wait, perhaps the number of teeth on the chain is the same as the sprocket's teeth, but the chain itself is a loop, so the number of teeth is determined by the sprocket. So the chain must have at least as many teeth as the largest sprocket. Here, the driven sprocket is 30 teeth, so the chain must have at least 30 teeth. But in our case, the chain's number of teeth is determined by the sprocket, not the other way around.

Wait, perhaps the chain's number of teeth is the same as the sprocket's, so the chain must have at least 30 teeth. But the options don't specify the number of teeth, just the pitch and strands.

I think I'm getting stuck on the wrong aspects. Let me try to summarize:

- Chain speed: ~523.6 in/min.

- Chain length: ~105 inches.

- Required pitch: Either 0.5" (no.50) or 0.625" (no.60).

- Tension: ~88 lbf.

- Number of strands: 1, 2, or 3.

Given that, the key is to choose a chain that can handle the tension and speed without breaking. Since the tension is about 88 lbf, even a single no.50 chain can handle it, as its tensile strength is around 2,000 lbf. So why would the options suggest using a triple-strand or no.60?

Wait, perhaps the chain's maximum operating speed is a factor. The no.50 chain has a higher maximum speed capacity than no.60. Since our chain speed is ~523.6 in/min (~43.6 ft/min), which is moderate, a no.50 chain should handle it fine.

Wait, but let me think about the chain's maximum allowable speed. For a no.50 chain, the maximum speed is typically around 300-400 ft/min. Since 43.6 ft/min is well below that, no problem.

Another factor is the risk of chain whipping or vibration at higher speeds, but again, 43 ft/min is manageable.

So, the main considerations are pitch, strands, and length.

If I go with a no.50 chain, the length is 210 links. For a single strand, that's acceptable. But perhaps the question is considering the power transmission efficiency and the number of teeth in engagement.

Wait, the number of teeth in engagement is the number of sprocket teeth, which is 20 on the driver and 30 on the driven. So the chain must have enough links to engage properly. The number of teeth on the chain itself is determined by the sprocket, but the chain's links need to mesh correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to ensure that the chain's pitch is compatible with the sprocket's teeth. The pitch must match the sprocket's pitch. Since the sprocket has a certain number of teeth, the pitch of the chain must match the pitch of the sprocket. But I think the sprocket pitch is determined by the chain pitch. For example, a no.50 chain has a 0.5" pitch, so the sprocket teeth must match that.

Assuming the sprocket is designed for a no.50 chain, then the pitch is 0.5". If the sprocket is for a no.60 chain, then the pitch is 0.625". So I need to ensure that the chain's pitch matches the sprocket's pitch.

But the question states that the driving sprocket has 20 teeth, and the driven has 30. So the pitch of the sprocket is based on the chain pitch. For example, for a no.50 chain, the sprocket pitch is 0.5". So the number of teeth on the sprocket must be such that the pitch diameter is correct. The pitch diameter (D) of a sprocket is given by D = p * (T + 2) / (2 * sin(π / T)), but perhaps an approximation is D ≈ p * T / π. So for T=20 and p=0.5", D ≈ (0.5 *20)/3.14 ≈10/3.14≈3.18 inches. Similarly, for T=30, D≈ (0.5 *30)/3.14≈15/3.14≈4.775 inches.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary here. The key point is that the chain's pitch must match the sprocket's pitch. So if the sprocket is designed for a no.50 chain, then the pitch is 0.5", and the chain must be no.50.

So the options are A, B, D for no.50, and C for no.60. So if the sprocket is designed for no.50, then the chain must be no.50.

Now, between the no.50 options: single, double, or triple strands.

The required tension is ~88 lbf. A single no.50 strand can handle up to around 2,000 lbf, so it's sufficient. But perhaps considering the power transmitted and the operational factors, a double or triple strand might be recommended for safety or to handle dynamic loads.

Alternatively, the number of strands also affects the chain's ability to handle the load and the wear rate. More strands distribute the load more, reducing the stress on each strand.

But in our case, since the required tension is only ~88 lbf, even a single strand should be okay. However, sometimes in industrial applications, a single strand might not be preferred due to the risk of breakage or other factors, so they might opt for a double or triple strand.

Wait, but looking at the options, D is a single-strand no.50 chain. A is double, B is triple, C is triple no.60.

If the calculation shows that a single strand can handle the load, then D would be the minimal option. But perhaps the question expects us to consider other factors, like the chain's efficiency or the number of teeth in engagement.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain's number of teeth (links) must be sufficient to avoid excessive wear. The number of links is 210 for no.50, which seems reasonable.

Another consideration is the chain's weight. A triple-strand chain would be heavier and more massive, which could affect the overall system's inertia and starting torque.

But given that the required tension is low, a single strand should suffice. So why are the options suggesting higher strands?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the tension. Let me double-check.

Power P = 7 hp = 7 * 550 = 3850 ft-lbf/min.

Chain speed V = (π * T1 * N1) / 60 = (3.1416 *20 *500)/60 ≈ (31416)/60 ≈523.6 in/min.

Wait, that's correct. So V =523.6 in/min =523.6/12 ≈43.63 ft/min.

Then, F = P / V = 3850 /43.63 ≈88.27 lbf.

So that's correct. Now, the chain's tensile strength must be higher than this to prevent breaking. But the static tension is only 88 lbf, so even a single no.50 chain can handle it.

However, in real applications, chains are rated for dynamic loads, which can be higher than static. So perhaps the dynamic tension could be higher, requiring a stronger chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain's operating speed is another factor. The no.50 chain's maximum speed is higher than no.60, so for our speed of ~43 ft/min, no.50 is suitable.

So, considering all this, the minimal chain would be a single-strand no.50 (option D). But wait, the options include D as single-strand no.50. However, I'm a bit unsure because in some cases, even though a single strand can handle the load, a double or triple strand might be used for reliability or to handle dynamic loads better.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the chain's capacity based on the number of teeth and strands. Let me think about the chain's power transmission capacity.

The power transmitted by a chain can be calculated using the formula:

P = (F * V) * Z / 1000

Where F is the tension in lbf, V in ft/min, and Z is the number of teeth in contact.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that formula. Another formula is P = (F * V * Z * p) / 1000, where p is the pitch. Let me try that.

F=88.27 lbf, V=43.63 ft/min, Z=20 (since the driving sprocket has 20 teeth), p=0.5 inches=0.04167 ft.

So P= (88.27 *43.63 *20 *0.04167)/1000 ≈ (88.27 *43.63 ≈3847) *20≈76,940 *0.04167≈3,208. So P≈3,208/1000≈3.2 hp.

But the motor is 7 hp, so that's only a fraction. So perhaps the chain's capacity is much higher than needed. Therefore, a single strand should suffice.

But wait, that calculation seems off. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is P = (F * V * Z * p) / 1000, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, the correct formula for power transmitted by a chain is P = (F * V) where F is in lbf and V in ft/min, giving P in horsepower as (F * V)/550.

So F=88.27 lbf, V=43.63 ft/min.

P=(88.27 *43.63)/550 ≈3,850 /550 =7 hp. That matches the motor's power, so that makes sense.

Therefore, the chain is operating at its maximum capacity. So the chain must be able to handle exactly 7 hp continuously.

Given that, the chain's tensile strength must be sufficient to handle the tension without failure over time. Since a single no.50 strand can handle around 2,000 lbf, which is well above the calculated 88 lbf, it should be fine.

But wait, that seems contradictory because the power is 7 hp, and the tension is only 88 lbf. How does that relate to the chain's tensile strength?

Ah, perhaps the tensile strength is the maximum load the chain can handle before breaking, while the operating tension is much lower. So as long as the operating tension is below the chain's tensile strength, it's fine.

In that case, a single no.50 chain should work. But perhaps the question is more about the chain's pitch and the number of teeth, ensuring that the chain doesn't slip or wear out quickly.

Another consideration is the number of teeth in contact. The driving sprocket has 20 teeth, so the chain must have enough links to ensure that multiple teeth are in contact, distributing the load and reducing wear. A longer chain (more links) would mean more teeth in contact, which is better. So a no.50 chain with 210 links would have more teeth in contact than a no.60 chain with 168 links, assuming the same number of teeth on the sprocket.

Wait, but the number of teeth in contact is determined by the sprocket teeth, not the chain. The chain links engage with the sprocket teeth, so the number of teeth in contact is the same as the sprocket's teeth. The chain's number of links doesn't directly affect the number of teeth in contact, as each link engages with one sprocket tooth at a time.

So, perhaps the key is to choose a chain that has a pitch that matches the sprocket and a sufficient number of strands to handle the load.

Given that, a single no.50 chain should suffice, but perhaps the question is expecting to consider the chain's speed and the number of teeth, leading to a different choice.

Wait, another angle: the chain's length and the number of links. For a no.50 chain, 210 links would mean a certain number of links per sprocket. The number of links around a sprocket is given by L = (π * D) / p, where D is the pitch diameter. For T=20, D≈3.18 inches. So L≈ (3.14 *3.18)/0.5 ≈20. So each sprocket would engage about 20 links. That seems correct.

But with 210 links, the chain is long enough without being too tight. So that's fine.

I think I've gone through all the factors. The required chain is a no.50 with sufficient strands. Since a single strand can handle the tension, but sometimes applications prefer more strands for safety or load distribution, the options include triple-strand no.50 and no.60.

But given the minimal required tension, a single no.50 should be sufficient, making option D the answer. However, perhaps the question expects a triple-strand for better load distribution, leading to option B.

Wait, but why would the question suggest that? Maybe I'm missing something in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain's required tensile strength is higher when considering dynamic loads or other factors. For example, the static tension is 88 lbf, but during acceleration or braking, the tension could be higher. So to account for that, a chain with a higher safety factor might be chosen.

In that case, perhaps a triple-strand no.50 chain would be more appropriate, as it can handle up to 6,000 lbf, providing a larger safety margin.

But without specific information on dynamic loads, it's hard to say. However, in industrial settings, using a triple-strand chain might be standard practice for a 7 hp motor, especially considering the center distance and the sprocket sizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain's pitch affects the number of teeth in contact, and a no.60 chain might be better for lower wear, but that would require a longer chain and possibly a larger center distance.

Wait, the center distance is 30 inches. If the chain pitch is larger (no.60, 0.625"), the number of links would be fewer, but the overall chain length might be similar. However, a no.60 chain would have fewer links, which could mean less flexibility and higher load per link, but also a stronger chain per strand.

But since the required tension is low, a no.50 chain should be sufficient. Therefore, between the options, D is single-strand no.50, which meets the requirements.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A: Double-strand no.50

B: Triple-strand no.50

C: Triple-strand no.60

D: Single-strand no.50

If the correct answer is D, why would the options include others? Perhaps I made a mistake in the tensile strength calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the chain's tensile strength is different. The tensile strength for a single no.50 chain is about 2,000 lbf, but when you have multiple strands, the total tensile strength is multiplied by the number of strands.

So for a single strand, 2,000 lbf; double, 4,000; triple, 6,000.

But our required tension is only ~88 lbf, so even a single strand is way overkill. Therefore, why would the options suggest using more strands? Perhaps the question is more about the chain's rating based on power and speed, not just tension.

Wait, another approach: the chain's power rating. The power a chain can transmit is based on its pitch, number of strands, and the speed.

The formula for the maximum power a chain can transmit is:

P = (F * V) * Z / 1000

Where F is the tension, V is the speed in ft/min, and Z is the number of teeth in contact.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the maximum power is given by:

P = (F * V * Z * p) / 1000

Where p is the pitch.

But without clear formulas, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I should look for a standard chain selection method.

In many cases, chain selection involves determining the required chain speed, the number of teeth, and then selecting a chain that can handle the load based on the manufacturer's tables.

From what I recall, the horsepower a chain can transmit is roughly proportional to its pitch, number of strands, and speed.

A no.50 single strand can handle up to about 3-5 hp, depending on the speed and load. A triple-strand no.50 can handle more, perhaps up to 15 hp or more. Similarly, a no.60 triple-strand can handle even higher.

Given that the motor is 7 hp, a triple-strand no.50 chain would be suitable, as it can handle up to around 15 hp. Therefore, option B or C.

But wait, the no.60 chain is larger, so perhaps it's overkill for 7 hp. So a triple-strand no.50 (option B) would be appropriate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the required chain based on the horsepower and speed.

The formula for chain power is:

P (hp) = (V (in/min) * F (lbf) * Z) / (33,000)

Where Z is the number of teeth in contact.

Wait, but again, I'm not certain. Alternatively, another formula is:

P (hp) = (F (lbf) * V (ft/min)) / 550

Which we used earlier, giving 7 hp.

So, the chain must be able to handle 7 hp. Let's look at the options' capacities.

Assuming:

- No.50 chain: up to ~3-5 hp per strand.

- No.60 chain: up to ~5-8 hp per strand.

Therefore, a triple-strand no.50 can handle up to ~15 hp, which is more than enough.

Thus, the correct answer would be B: Triple-strand no.50 chain.

To determine the appropriate driving chain for the given motor setup, the following factors were analyzed:

1. **Speed Ratio and Chain Speed**:  
   The motor runs at 500 rpm, and the driven sprocket runs at 300 rpm. The speed ratio is 5:3, which is consistent with the sprocket teeth ratio (20:30). The chain speed was calculated as approximately **523.6 inches per minute (in/min)**.

2. **Chain Length**:  
   Using the center distance of 30 inches and the sprocket teeth, the chain length was approximated to be **105 inches**.

3. **Pitch of the Chain**:  
   The options include no. 50 (pitch = 0.5 inches) and no. 60 (pitch = 0.625 inches). The number of links for no. 50 is 210, and for no. 60, it is 168. A no. 50 chain is better suited for higher speeds, which aligns with the calculated chain speed of ~523.6 in/min.

4. **Tension and Tensile Strength**:  
   The required tension was calculated as ~88.27 lbf. A single no. 50 chain can handle up to ~2,000 lbf, making it sufficient for the load. However, considering dynamic loads and safety factors, a triple-strand no. 50 chain provides a higher safety margin, capable of handling up to ~6,000 lbf.

5. **Power Transmission Capacity**:  
   The motor is 7 hp, and the chain must transmit this power efficiently. A triple-strand no. 50 chain can handle up to ~15 hp, which is more than sufficient for the application. A no. 60 chain, while capable, is unnecessary given the lower power requirement.

6. **Load Distribution and Reliability**:  
   A triple-strand chain distributes the load more evenly across multiple strands, reducing wear and tear on individual links. This makes it a more reliable choice for continuous operation.

Given the analysis, the triple-strand no. 50 chain (Option B) is the most appropriate choice, as it meets the power, speed, and load requirements while providing a safety margin.

**Answer: B**
