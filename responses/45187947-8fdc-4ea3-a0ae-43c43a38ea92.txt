Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, and I need to figure out whether the two statements are true or not. Let's take it step by step.

Statement 1 says: If a finite group has order n, then the group contains a subgroup of order d for every positive divisor d of n. Hmm, I remember something about Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. But that's about existing divisors, not necessarily every single one. Wait, isn't there a theorem that says every finite group has subgroups of every order that divides the group's order? Or is that only under certain conditions?

Oh right! I think Sylow's theorems might be related here. Sylow's first theorem says that for every prime power dividing the group order, there exists a subgroup of that order. But wait, does Sylow's theorem cover all divisors, not just prime powers? Or does it require the group to be something specific, like solvable?

Wait no, Sylow's theorems are about p-subgroups, specifically. So maybe that's not exactly what's needed here. Oh, right, the statement is about having a subgroup for every positive divisor d of n. I think this is actually true for finite abelian groups, but does it hold for all finite groups?

Wait, no, I remember now. The statement that every finite group has a subgroup of every order dividing its order is not true in general. Wait, actually, no, Sylow's theorems only guarantee subgroups of prime power orders, not every possible divisor. So perhaps the first statement is false. But wait, no, I'm confusing things. Let me think again.

Oh wait, actually, I think there's a theorem by Lagrange which says that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group, but it doesn't say every such order must be represented by a subgroup. So the converse isn't necessarily true. So Statement 1 is claiming that for any divisor d of n, there exists a subgroup of order d. Is that always true?

I think it's not true for all finite groups. For example, consider a group of order 6. The symmetric group S3 has order 6. Its subgroups are of order 1, 2, 3, and 6. So for d=2, there are subgroups, like the cyclic subgroup generated by a transposition. For d=3, the alternating group A3 is a subgroup. So in this case, it does hold. But wait, is there a group where it doesn't hold? Maybe a group of order 4? Wait, no, the Klein four-group has subgroups of order 2 and 4, and the cyclic group of order 4 also does. So perhaps all groups of order p^k have subgroups for each divisor.

Wait, but what about a group like the alternating group A4? Its order is 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Does A4 have a subgroup of order 4? Yes, it does. For example, the Klein four-group is a subgroup. How about order 6? Yes, A4 has a subgroup isomorphic to S3, which has order 6. So in this case, it works. Hmm, maybe I'm not remembering correctly.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing with the concept of cyclic groups. In cyclic groups, for every divisor d of n, there exists a unique subgroup of order d. So for cyclic groups, Statement 1 is definitely true. But does this hold for all finite groups?

Wait, I think the answer is no. There's a theorem called Cauchy's theorem, which says that if a prime p divides the order of the group, then the group has an element of order p, hence a cyclic subgroup of order p. But that's just for primes, not for all divisors. So for composite divisors, it's not guaranteed? Or is it?

Wait, no, the statement is about having a subgroup for every d, not necessarily cyclic. So perhaps even if the group isn't cyclic, it still has subgroups of every order dividing n. But I'm not sure. I think that's actually a theorem called the converse of Lagrange's theorem, but I thought it's not true.

Wait, no, the converse of Lagrange's theorem would be that if d divides n, then there's a subgroup of order d. But I think that's not true in general. For example, consider the group of order 4, the Klein four-group. It has subgroups of order 1, 2, and 4. So for d=2, yes. Another example: the group of order 6, S3, which has subgroups of order 1,2,3,6. So in these small cases, it holds.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a counterexample. Let's think of a group of order 8. Take the dihedral group D4, which has order 8. Its subgroups are of order 1, 2, 4, and 8. So it has subgroups of order 4. Wait, but does it have a subgroup of order 2? Yes, generated by a rotation of 180 degrees or a reflection. So that works.

Wait, maybe I'm not finding a counterexample because I'm not looking hard enough. Let me think of a group of order 12. The alternating group A4 has order 12. Does it have a subgroup of order 4? Yes, the Klein four-group is a subgroup. Does it have a subgroup of order 6? Yes, like the S3 inside it. So that works.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check online (but since I can't, I'll try to recall). Oh, I think that the statement is actually false. The correct theorem is that for every finite group, the lattice of subgroups is such that for every d dividing n, there's a subgroup of order d, but only if certain conditions are met. Wait, no, actually, I'm wrong. Wait, no, I think the correct statement is that every finite group has a subgroup of order d for every d dividing n, but that's only true if G is solvable, or maybe under certain conditions.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, no. I think I'm confusing with the Sylow theorems. Sylow's first theorem says that for every prime power p^k dividing the group order, there's a subgroup of order p^k. But that's not the same as every divisor. So for example, a group of order 12 might not have a subgroup of order 4? No, wait, A4 does have a subgroup of order 4. So maybe in general, it's true.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong and Statement 1 is actually true. Because I think that for any finite group, it does have a subgroup for every divisor of its order. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, no, I think I'm wrong. Because if I remember correctly, there's a theorem that says that for a finite group, the existence of a subgroup of every order dividing the group order is equivalent to the group being solvable, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's only true for abelian groups.

Wait, no, that's not right. I think the correct statement is that every finite group does have subgroups of order d for every d dividing n. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe only for certain groups.

Wait, perhaps I should think of a specific example where a group doesn't have a subgroup of a certain divisor. Let me think of a group of order 16. Suppose we take the group as the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, Z4 × Z4. This group has order 16. Its subgroups include orders 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. Wait, does it have a subgroup of order 8? Yes, because it's abelian, so it's cyclic, so it has a subgroup of order 8. Wait, no, wait, Z4 × Z4 is not cyclic, because 4 and 4 are not coprime. So the exponent is 4, but the group isn't cyclic. So in this case, does it have a subgroup of order 8?

Hmm, wait, in Z4 × Z4, the elements have orders 1, 2, or 4. So to find a subgroup of order 8, perhaps generated by two elements. Let me see, the subgroup generated by (1,0) and (0,1) would be of order 4, since each has order 4 and they commute. Wait, but maybe another combination. Alternatively, maybe the group doesn't have a subgroup of order 8. Wait, no, wait, in an abelian group, for every divisor d of the group order, there exists a subgroup of order d. So even if it's not cyclic, it's true for abelian groups. So in Z4 × Z4, which is abelian, it does have a subgroup of order 8. So that's okay.

Wait, but what about a non-abelian group? Let's think of the symmetric group S3 again, which is non-abelian and of order 6. It has subgroups of order 1, 2, 3, 6. So that works. Another non-abelian group: the dihedral group D4 of order 8. It has subgroups of order 1, 2, 4, 8. So that works too.

Wait, maybe I'm not finding a counterexample because I'm not looking at the right groups. Let me think of a group of order 12 that's non-abelian. The dihedral group D6 has order 12. It should have subgroups of order 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Does it have a subgroup of order 4? Yes, because it's generated by a rotation of 180 degrees, which has order 2, but wait, that's order 2. Wait, D6 is the symmetries of a hexagon. Its elements include rotations by 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 degrees, and reflections. So the rotation subgroup is cyclic of order 6. So in D6, the subgroups include those of order 1, 2, 3, 6, and the dihedral group itself. Wait, but does it have a subgroup of order 4? Because 4 divides 12. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, but I thought D6 is non-abelian of order 12. Let me check.

Wait, no, D6 has order 12, and its subgroups include the cyclic subgroup of rotations of order 6, and then the reflections. So the subgroups would be: trivial group, the cyclic subgroups of order 2 (rotations by 180 degrees), order 3 (rotations by 120 and 240 degrees), and the entire group. Wait, but does it have a subgroup of order 4? Because 4 divides 12, but I don't think so. Because the only elements are rotations and reflections. The rotations form a cyclic group of order 6, which has subgroups of order 1, 2, 3, and 6. The reflections would form a set, but not a subgroup on their own because the product of two reflections is a rotation. So in D6, the only subgroups are of order 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12. So there's no subgroup of order 4. Therefore, Statement 1 is false because for D6, which has order 12, there's no subgroup of order 4, even though 4 divides 12.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Because in D6, the order is 12, and 4 is a divisor. But the group doesn't have a subgroup of order 4. Therefore, Statement 1 is false. So that means Statement 1 is not true in general. So the first statement is false.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: If a belongs to a finite group, then |a| divides |G|. Hmm, I think this is true. Because by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element divides the order of the group. Because the order of an element is the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by that element, and Lagrange's theorem says that the order of the subgroup divides the order of the group. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but the options are about whether each statement is true or not, and how they interact. So Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true.

Looking at the options:

A: True, True → No, because Statement 1 is false.

B: True, False → No, because Statement 2 is true.

C: Statement 1 is false for infinite groups, Statement 2 is true → But Statement 1 is about finite groups, so C is not the answer.

D: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false for non-abelian → No, because Statement 2 is true regardless.

E: Statement 1 true only for abelian, Statement 2 true → No, because Statement 1 is false in general.

F: False, False → No, because Statement 2 is true.

G: Statement 1 false for non-abelian, Statement 2 false → No, Statement 2 is true.

H: False, True → Yes, because Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true.

I: Both statements true for cyclic groups only → No, because Statement 2 is true for all finite groups.

J: Statement 1 true only for cyclic groups, Statement 2 true → No, because Statement 1 is false in general.

So the correct option is H: False, True.
</think>

The first statement is false because not every finite group has a subgroup of order d for every positive divisor d of n. For example, the dihedral group D6 of order 12 does not have a subgroup of order 4, even though 4 divides 12. The second statement is true because, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in a finite group divides the order of the group. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H
