Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the selling price of a plot of land and then figuring out the net price after commission. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the plot is 100 feet by 40 feet. The question says it's sold for $75 a front foot. Hmm, I'm assuming "front foot" refers to the price per linear foot along the front of the plot. So I think I need to find out how much the frontage is. Since the plot is 100 feet by 40 feet, the frontage is probably the longer side, which is 100 feet. Wait, no, maybe it's the side that's facing the street or whatever the front is. But in real estate, sometimes the "front foot" is the length along the street, so if the plot is 100 feet deep and 40 feet wide, the frontage would be 40 feet, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, maybe the frontage is the 100 feet side. Let me think: when you're selling land by the front foot, it's usually the width along the road. So if the plot is 100 feet by 40 feet, the frontage is 40 feet, and the depth is 100 feet. Wait, maybe not. I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should just go with the given information. The problem says it's sold for $75 a front foot. So maybe the frontage is 100 feet because that's the longer side. Or perhaps it's the 40 feet. Hmm. Wait, no, in real estate, the front foot is the width along the street. So if the plot is 100 feet by 40 feet, the frontage is 40 feet, and the depth is 100 feet. So the price per front foot would be $75, so the total selling price would be 40 feet multiplied by $75 per foot.

Wait, but let me make sure. If the plot is 100 feet by 40 feet, and the front foot is 40 feet, then the selling price would be 40 * 75 = $3,000. That's the gross selling price. Then the broker takes 7.5% commission. So 7.5% of 3,000 is 225. So the net selling price would be 3,000 - 225 = $2,775.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the frontage is 100 feet because that's the side facing the street. So if front foot is 100 feet, then the gross would be 100 *75 = $7,500. Then commission is 7.5% of 7,500, which is 562.5. So net would be 7,500 - 562.5 = 6,937.5, which isn't one of the options. So that can't be right.

Wait, but the options are A: 3,225, B:75, C:2,625, D:7,500, E:2,850, F:2,775, G:3,000, H:2,925, I:3,150, J:225.

So if I take the frontage as 40 feet, then gross is 40 *75=3,000. Broker takes 7.5% of 3,000: 7.5% is 0.075, so 3,000 *0.075=225. So net is 3,000 -225=2,775, which is option F.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the plot's frontage is 100 feet because it's the length along the street, so that would make the gross 100*75=7,500. Then commission is 7.5% of that, which is 562.5, so net would be 7,500 -562.5=6,937.5, which isn't an option. So that can't be right. So probably, the frontage is 40 feet.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question says "a plot of land 100 feet by 40 feet is sold for $75 a front foot." So perhaps the "front foot" is the width, so 40 feet, so the price is 40 *75 = 3,000. Then the broker takes 7.5% commission, which is 225, so net is 2,775, which is option F.

Alternatively, maybe the front foot refers to the entire perimeter, but that doesn't make sense. No, front foot is typically the width along the street, so 40 feet.

So the steps are:

1. Calculate gross selling price: frontage (40 feet) * $75/foot = 40*75=3,000.

2. Broker's commission: 7.5% of 3,000= 225.

3. Net selling price: 3,000 -225=2,775.

Looking at the options, F is 2,775, so that must be the answer.

The plot's frontage is 40 feet, so the gross selling price is 40 * $75 = $3,000. The broker's 7.5% commission is $225, so the net selling price is $2,775.

Answer: F
