Okay, so I've got this question about which hormone is responsible for metamorphosis in amphibians. Hmm, I remember that metamorphosis is a big change, like when a frog goes from a tadpole to a frog. I think it's controlled by some hormone.

Let me think about the options. The choices are A through J, with various hormones listed. I know that growth hormone (A) is involved in growth, but is it the key here? Probably not, since growth is more general.

Then there's estrogen (B) and testosterone (F), which are sex hormones. They play roles in development, but I'm not sure if they're directly responsible for the transformation from tadpole to frog. Maybe, but I think there's a more specific hormone.

Thyroxine (C) comes to mind. I recall that the thyroid gland produces thyroxine, and it's involved in metabolism and development. Oh wait, in amphibians, the thyroid hormone, which is thyroxine, triggers metamorphosis. So that might be the right answer.

Insulin (D) is about regulating blood sugar and isn't directly linked to metamorphosis as far as I know. Prolactin (E) is involved in milk production and maybe stress, so probably not.

Cortisol (G) is a stress hormone, part of the fight-or-flight response. Adrenaline (H) is another stress hormone, but again, not directly related to the transformation process.

Melatonin (I) is about sleep cycles, and progesterone (J) is a reproductive hormone, so those don't seem relevant here.

So putting it all together, the key hormone for metamorphosis in amphibians is thyroxine. That's probably option C.

The hormone responsible for metamorphosis in amphibians is thyroxine, which is produced by the thyroid gland and regulates developmental changes.
