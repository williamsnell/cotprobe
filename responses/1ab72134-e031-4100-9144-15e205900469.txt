Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me write down what I know and then work through each part.

The question gives me two probabilities: P(A) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.2. Then it asks for the probability of the union P(A ∪ B) under three different scenarios: when A and B are mutually exclusive, when they are independent, and when B is a subset of A. There are multiple-choice options provided, from A to J, each giving three probabilities corresponding to these three cases.

First, I'll tackle each scenario one by one.

1. **Mutually Exclusive:**
   When two events are mutually exclusive, they cannot happen at the same time. That means the probability of their intersection, P(A ∩ B), is zero. The formula for the union of two events is:
   P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
   Since P(A ∩ B) = 0 in this case, the equation simplifies to:
   P(A ∪ B) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5.
   So, the first value is 0.5.

2. **Independent Events:**
   If A and B are independent, the occurrence of one doesn't affect the other. For independent events, the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities:
   P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06.
   Plugging this into the union formula:
   P(A ∪ B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.06 = 0.44.
   So, the second value is 0.44.

3. **B is a subset of A:**
   If B is a subset of A, that means every outcome in B is also in A. So, the intersection P(A ∩ B) is just P(B), because B can't have any outcomes outside of A. Therefore:
   P(A ∩ B) = P(B) = 0.2.
   Using the union formula:
   P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.2 = 0.3.
   So, the third value is 0.3.

Now, I need to match these results to the options given. The three probabilities are 0.5, 0.44, and 0.3. Let's look at each option:

- Option A: .44, 0.6, 0.2 → No, because the first value is 0.44 which isn't our 0.5 for mutual exclusivity.
- Option B: .5, 0.6, 0.3 → The first is correct, but the second is 0.6 instead of 0.44. So no.
- Option C: .44, 0.5, 0.3 → First is wrong, second is 0.5 instead of 0.44.
- Option D: .5, 0.44, 0.3 → All three match! First 0.5, second 0.44, third 0.3.
- Option E: .5, 0.44, 0.2 → Third is wrong.
- Option F: 0.6, 0.44, 0.3 → First is wrong.
- Option G: 0.5, 0.5, 0.3 → Second is wrong.
- Option H: 0.6, 0.44, 0.2 → First and third wrong.
- Option I: 0.44, 0.5, 0.2 → All wrong.
- Option J: 0.44, 0.5, 0.2 → Same as I.

So, the correct option is D: .5, 0.44, 0.3.

The probability of the union for mutually exclusive events is 0.5, for independent events it's 0.44, and when B is a subset of A it's 0.3. The correct option is D.

Answer: D
