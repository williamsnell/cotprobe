Okay, so I've got this question about the retributive theory of punishment, and I need to figure out which statement it does not claim. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that retributive theories are about punishment being deserved. The main idea is that offenders should get what they deserve, which is often phrased as "an eye for an eye." So, the punishment should fit the crime, which is a common saying related to retributive justice. That makes me think that options C and D are probably things that retributive theory does claim because they talk about the punishment fitting the crime and being as severe as the crime.

Looking at option B: "wrongdoers deserve to be punished." That sounds exactly like the core of retributive theory. Retribution is all about desert, so B is definitely something the theory does claim. So B is not the answer we're looking for.

Option E says, "wrongdoers should be punished regardless of their personal circumstances." Retributive theory focuses on the action itself and desert, not on the circumstances of the wrongdoer. So even if someone has personal issues, retributivists would still say they deserve punishment based on their actions. So E is something the theory does claim, meaning E isn't the correct answer.

Option F mentions the death penalty being morally justified in some cases of murder. Retributive theory doesn't necessarily oppose the death penalty; in fact, some retributivists might support it for severe crimes like murder. So F is something the theory could claim, so F isn't the answer.

That leaves A: "specific punishments are justified based on the overall intrinsic value that they produce." I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Retributive theory is more about desert and the moral justification of punishment because it's deserved, not necessarily about the overall value or benefits produced by the punishment. Utilitarian theories focus on consequences and intrinsic value, like how punishment can reduce crime or promote welfare. Retributive theory is retributive, not consequentialist. So A is about justifying punishments based on their value outcomes, which sounds more like a utilitarian approach. Therefore, the retributive theory doesn't base its justification on the intrinsic value produced but rather on desert.

So putting it all together, the theory does not claim A. The other options (B, C, D, E, F) are all things the retributive theory does claim.

The retributive theory of punishment focuses on the idea that wrongdoers deserve punishment based on the severity of their actions, emphasizing that the punishment should fit the crime. It does not, however, justify specific punishments based on the overall intrinsic value they produce, as this is more aligned with consequentialist theories. 

Answer: A
