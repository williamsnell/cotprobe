Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here about similar polygons, and I need to find the length of FD. Let me see if I can figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on similar polygons, but I remember that their corresponding sides are proportional. So first, I should probably figure out which sides correspond in the two polygons.

The polygons are ACDF and VWYZ. Let me write down their vertices in order: ACDF and VWYZ. So A corresponds to V, C corresponds to W, D corresponds to Y, and F corresponds to Z. Wait, is that right? Or maybe I should look at the order of the letters to see the correspondence. So ACDF is a four-sided polygon, and VWYZ is another four-sided polygon. So the order is A to C to D to F, so the sides are AC, CD, DF, and FA. Similarly, VW, WY, YZ, and ZV. So the corresponding sides would be AC to VW, CD to WY, DF to YZ, and FA to ZV.

Wait, but the problem gives me AF = 12. AF is a diagonal, not a side. Hmm, maybe I should think about the sides given. They gave CD = 9 and YZ = 10. So CD corresponds to WY, perhaps? Or maybe CD corresponds to YZ? Wait, no, because CD is the third side in ACDF, and YZ is the third side in VWYZ. So CD corresponds to YZ. Let me check that.

If ACDF ~ VWYZ, then the order is A→V, C→W, D→Y, F→Z. So the sides would be AC ~ VW, CD ~ WY, DF ~ YZ, and FA ~ ZV. So CD corresponds to WY, and DF corresponds to YZ. But the problem says YZ is 10, CD is 9, so perhaps the scale factor is 10/9? Wait, but let me make sure.

Wait, the problem says polygon ACDF is similar to polygon VWYZ. So the ratio of similarity would be the ratio of corresponding sides. So CD is a side in ACDF, and its corresponding side in VWYZ is WY. But the problem gives CD = 9 and YZ = 10. Wait, maybe I'm getting the correspondences wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the order is A to C to D to F, so the sides are AC, CD, DF, FA. In VWYZ, the order is V to W to Y to Z, so the sides are VW, WY, YZ, ZV. So CD in ACDF corresponds to WY in VWYZ. So CD = 9 corresponds to WY, which is in the problem, but I don't know its length yet. Wait, the problem gives YZ = 10, which is another side, and ZV is given as 3y-1, but I'm not sure what that refers to yet.

Wait, maybe I should list out the sides:

ACDF sides: AC, CD, DF, FA.

VWXYZ sides: VW, WY, YZ, ZV.

So the corresponding sides are AC ↔ VW, CD ↔ WY, DF ↔ YZ, FA ↔ ZV.

So the scale factor would be the ratio between corresponding sides. Let's say the scale factor from ACDF to VWYZ is k. So each side in VWYZ is k times the corresponding side in ACDF.

Given that CD = 9, which corresponds to WY. So WY = k * CD = 9k.

Similarly, DF corresponds to YZ. Given that YZ = 10, so DF = (10) / k. Because if YZ is the larger one, then k would be less than 1, meaning ACDF is smaller than VWYZ.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The scale factor k is such that each side in VWYZ is k times the corresponding side in ACDF. So if ACDF is similar to VWYZ, then ACDF's sides are multiplied by k to get VWYZ's sides. So if CD is 9, then WY would be 9k. Similarly, DF would correspond to YZ, so YZ = DF * k. So DF = YZ / k = 10 / k.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the ratio of ACDF to VWYZ is k, so each side in ACDF is k times the corresponding side in VWYZ. So CD (9) would be k times WY, so WY = 9/k. Similarly, DF would be k times YZ, so DF = k * YZ = 10k. Hmm, that might make more sense.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by considering the scale factor. Let's say the scale factor from ACDF to VWYZ is k. So each side in VWYZ is k times the corresponding side in ACDF.

So CD in ACDF is 9, so WY in VWYZ is 9k.

Similarly, YZ in VWYZ is 10, which corresponds to DF in ACDF. So DF in ACDF is (10)/k because YZ = DF * k → DF = YZ / k.

Wait, but the problem is asking for FD, which is the same as DF, right? Because FD is the side from F to D, which is the same as DF.

So FD = DF = YZ / k = 10 / k.

But I don't know k yet. How can I find k?

I have another piece of information: AF = 12. AF is a side in ACDF, corresponding to ZV in VWYZ. Because FA corresponds to ZV. So FA = 12, ZV = 3y - 1. So FA corresponds to ZV, so ZV = FA * k → 3y - 1 = 12k.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the correspondence, FA in ACDF corresponds to ZV in VWYZ. So FA is the side from F to A, and ZV is the side from Z to V. So yes, FA corresponds to ZV. So FA = 12, ZV = 3y - 1.

So FA corresponds to ZV, so ZV = k * FA → 3y -1 = k * 12.

Wait, but I'm using y here, but the problem says ZV = 3y -1. Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo. Because in the problem, it's written as ZV = 3y -1. I think it's supposed to be ZV = 3y -1, but perhaps it's a variable, but that complicates things because we don't know y. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be 3k -1? Or perhaps it's 3y -1, but I'm not sure. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's list all the corresponding sides and their relationships.

1. AC corresponds to VW, so AC = k * VW → AC = k * VW.

2. CD corresponds to WY, so CD = k * WY → 9 = k * WY → WY = 9/k.

3. DF corresponds to YZ, so DF = k * YZ → DF = k * 10.

4. FA corresponds to ZV, so FA = k * ZV → 12 = k * ZV → ZV = 12/k.

But the problem gives ZV = 3y -1. So ZV = 12/k = 3y -1. Hmm, but I don't know what y is here. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps ZV = 3y -1 is a typo, and it's supposed to be ZV = 3k -1? Or perhaps it's 3y -1, where y is a variable, but that seems odd because we're given numerical values elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

We have two similar polygons: ACDF and VWYZ. So their corresponding sides are proportional.

Given:
- CD = 9 in ACDF, which corresponds to WY in VWYZ.
- YZ = 10 in VWYZ, which corresponds to DF in ACDF.
- AF = 12 in ACDF, which corresponds to ZV in VWYZ.

So, let's denote the scale factor as k, where k is the ratio of the sides of VWYZ to ACDF. So each side in VWYZ is k times the corresponding side in ACDF.

Therefore:
- WY = CD * k = 9k
- DF = YZ / k = 10/k (since YZ = DF * k)
- ZV = AF * k = 12k

But the problem states that ZV = 3y -1. Wait, but ZV is a length, so 3y -1 must be a length. That suggests that y is a variable, but I don't have any other equations involving y. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and it should be ZV = 3k -1. Let me assume that for a moment.

Assuming ZV = 3k -1, and since ZV = 12k (from the scale factor), we have:

12k = 3k -1

Wait, that would give 12k -3k = -1 → 9k = -1 → k = -1/9. That doesn't make sense because scale factors are positive. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps ZV is given as 3y -1, where y is another length. But without more information, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can find the scale factor k using another pair of corresponding sides. For example, from AF and ZV.

We have AF = 12, which corresponds to ZV. So ZV = AF * k → ZV = 12k.

But the problem says ZV = 3y -1. So 12k = 3y -1. Hmm, but without knowing y, I can't proceed. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the perimeter is proportional, but I don't have perimeters given. Alternatively, maybe I can find another corresponding side.

Wait, let's see. The problem gives CD = 9, which is in ACDF, and YZ = 10 in VWYZ. Since CD corresponds to WY, and DF corresponds to YZ, perhaps I can find the scale factor using CD and YZ.

Wait, no, because CD corresponds to WY, not YZ. So CD = 9 corresponds to WY, which is unknown. And DF corresponds to YZ =10, so DF = 10/k.

Wait, maybe I can find another relationship. Let's see, FA corresponds to ZV, so FA =12, ZV = 3y -1. So FA =12, ZV =12k. So 12k = 3y -1. But without another equation, I can't solve for y or k.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the polygons are similar, so all corresponding sides are in the same ratio. Let's see:

We have AF = 12 corresponds to ZV = 3y -1. So 12 / (3y -1) = k.

Similarly, CD =9 corresponds to WY, which is k *9.

And DF corresponds to YZ=10, so DF =10/k.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me list all the given information again:

- ACDF ~ VWYZ
- AF = 12
- CD = 9
- YZ = 10
- ZV = 3y -1
- Find FD (which is DF)

So, AF corresponds to ZV, so AF/ZV = k (since AF is in ACDF and ZV in VWYZ, which is larger, so k>1).

So, 12 / (3y -1) = k.

Also, CD=9 corresponds to WY, so WY =9k.

YZ=10 corresponds to DF, so DF =10/k.

Wait, but I also have another correspondence: maybe the sides AC and VW. But I don't know their lengths.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up the ratio using FA and ZV, and then use CD and WY to find k.

Wait, let me try that. From AF and ZV:

k = AF / ZV = 12 / (3y -1).

But I don't know y yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can express y in terms of k.

From ZV = 3y -1, and ZV =12k, so 12k =3y -1 → 3y =12k +1 → y = (12k +1)/3 =4k + 1/3.

Hmm, that's an expression for y in terms of k. But I'm not sure if that helps me.

Wait, maybe I can find another equation involving k. Let's think about the side DF, which is 10/k.

But FD is DF, so FD =10/k. That's the value we need to find.

So if I can find k, I can find FD.

Let me see if I can find another equation involving k.

We have CD=9 corresponds to WY=9k.

But I don't know WY's length. Unless there's another way to find WY.

Wait, maybe the sum of the sides in a polygon? But without knowing all the sides, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the perimeter is proportional. But again, without knowing all sides, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that in polygon VWYZ, the sides are VW, WY, YZ, ZV. So VW + WY + YZ + ZV is the perimeter. Similarly, AC + CD + DF + FA is the perimeter of ACDF.

But without knowing AC or VW, I can't proceed that way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in similar polygons, the ratio of any corresponding linear measurements is the same.

So, let's think about AF and ZV again. AF =12, ZV =3y -1. So the ratio k = AF / ZV =12 / (3y -1).

Similarly, CD=9 corresponds to WY=9k.

But I don't know WY's length, so that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I can use another pair of corresponding sides. Let's think about AC and VW. But I don't have their lengths.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an expression involving DF and set it equal to 10/k.

Wait, but I don't have enough information. I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently.

Since ACDF ~ VWYZ, the ratio of AF to ZV is the same as the ratio of CD to WY, and the same as DF to YZ.

So, AF / ZV = CD / WY = DF / YZ = k.

Given that AF =12, ZV =3y-1, CD=9, YZ=10.

So, let's write the ratios:

12 / (3y -1) = 9 / WY = DF / 10.

But I don't know WY or DF.

Wait, but from CD / WY = 9 / WY = k, and AF / ZV =12 / (3y-1)=k.

So, 9 / WY =12 / (3y-1).

But I don't know WY or y. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express WY in terms of k: WY =9k.

Then, ZV =3y -1 =12k.

So, 3y =12k +1 → y =4k + 1/3.

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can find another equation involving WY.

In polygon VWYZ, the sides are VW, WY, YZ, ZV.

So, the perimeter of VWYZ is VW + WY + YZ + ZV.

Similarly, the perimeter of ACDF is AC + CD + DF + FA.

But without knowing AC or VW, I can't relate them.

Wait, maybe I can express DF in terms of k, which is FD = DF =10/k, and that's what I'm trying to find.

So, perhaps I can find k from another pair of sides.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in similar polygons, the ratio of the areas is the square of the scale factor, but I don't have any area information.

Alternatively, maybe I can find k using the fact that AF corresponds to ZV, and CD corresponds to WY.

Wait, but I'm stuck because I don't have enough equations.

Wait, perhaps I should make an assumption that the scale factor k is such that all the sides correspond correctly, and try to solve for k.

Let me try that.

From AF =12, ZV =3y -1.

So, 12 / (3y -1) =k.

From CD=9, WY=9k.

From YZ=10, DF=10/k.

But I don't have any other equations. Unless I can find another relationship involving y.

Wait, maybe I can consider that ZV is a side in VWYZ, which is the polygon. So ZV is the side from Z to V, which is the same as the side FA in ACDF. So ZV = FA * k =12k.

But the problem states that ZV =3y -1, so 12k =3y -1.

So, 3y =12k +1 → y =4k + 1/3.

But I still don't know y, so I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and ZV is meant to be 3k -1 instead of 3y -1. Let me try that.

If ZV =3k -1, then 3k -1 =12k → 3k -12k =1 → -9k=1 →k= -1/9. That's impossible because scale factors can't be negative. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe it's 3y -1, but y is another side length. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the sides again.

We have:

AF =12, which corresponds to ZV=3y-1. So AF/ZV =k →12/(3y-1)=k.

CD=9 corresponds to WY=9k.

YZ=10 corresponds to DF=10/k.

So, FD is DF, which is 10/k.

So, if I can find k, I can find FD.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in polygon VWYZ, the sides must satisfy certain properties, like the sum of consecutive sides or something else. But without knowing more sides, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the sides correspond in the order, so the sides AC, CD, DF, FA correspond to VW, WY, YZ, ZV. So, the order is correct.

Wait, perhaps I can set up a proportion using AF and ZV, and CD and WY.

So, AF/ZV = CD/WY →12/(3y-1) =9/WY.

But I don't know WY yet.

Alternatively, since CD=9 corresponds to WY, WY=9k.

So, AF/ZV = CD/WY →12/(3y-1) =9/(9k) → 12/(3y-1) =1/k.

So, 12/(3y-1) =1/k →k= (3y-1)/12.

But we also have ZV=3y-1=12k → 3y-1=12k.

So, substituting k from earlier: k=(3y-1)/12 →3y-1=12*(3y-1)/12 →3y-1=3y-1. That's an identity, which doesn't help.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can express y in terms of k from ZV=12k=3y-1 →3y=12k+1 →y=4k +1/3.

But I don't know y, so I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I can find another relationship involving k and y. Let's see.

We have DF=10/k, which is FD.

But I don't have any other information about DF.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the sum of the sides of ACDF is equal to the sum of the sides of VWYZ multiplied by k. But without knowing all the sides, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the perimeter of ACDF is AC + CD + DF + FA = AC +9 + (10/k) +12.

The perimeter of VWYZ is VW + WY + YZ + ZV = VW +9k +10 +12k.

But without knowing VW or AC, I can't relate them.

Wait, maybe I can consider the ratio of perimeters, which should be the same as the scale factor k.

So, (AC +9 +10/k +12) / (VW +9k +10 +12k) =k.

But without knowing AC and VW, I can't solve this.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in similar polygons, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. So, AF/ZV = CD/WY = DF/YZ =k.

From AF/ZV =k →12/(3y-1)=k.

From CD/WY=9/WY=k → WY=9/k.

From DF/YZ= (10/k)/10=1/k → which matches.

So, the only equation I have is 12/(3y-1)=k.

But I need another equation to solve for k.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that in polygon VWYZ, the sides are VW, WY, YZ, ZV.

So, the sides are VW, WY=9k, YZ=10, ZV=12k.

So, the perimeter of VWYZ is VW +9k +10 +12k =VW +21k +10.

Similarly, the perimeter of ACDF is AC +9 + (10/k) +12.

But without knowing AC or VW, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe I can relate AC and VW through the scale factor.

Since AC corresponds to VW, AC = VW/k.

So, AC = VW/k → VW=AC *k.

But again, without knowing AC, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I can look for a ratio involving the perimeters.

The ratio of perimeters is k, so:

(AC +9 +10/k +12) / (VW +9k +10 +12k) =k.

But since AC = VW/k, substituting:

(VW/k +9 +10/k +12) / (VW +9k +10 +12k) =k.

Let me multiply numerator and denominator by k to eliminate denominators:

(VW +9k +10 +12k) / (VW +9k +10 +12k) =k.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply 1=k, which is not possible unless k=1, which would make the polygons congruent, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me try again.

AC = VW/k → VW=AC *k.

So, AC +9 +10/k +12 = AC +9 + (10/k) +12.

VW +9k +10 +12k = AC *k +9k +10 +12k.

So, the ratio is:

(AC +9 +10/k +12) / (AC *k +9k +10 +12k) =k.

Multiply numerator and denominator by k:

(AC *k +9k +10 +12k) / (AC *k^2 +9k^2 +10k +12k^2) =k^2.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me try to think differently. Since I'm stuck, maybe I can make an assumption to find k.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that k is a rational number, and try to find it by trial and error.

Let me see. From ZV=12k=3y-1.

So, 12k =3y -1 →3y=12k +1 →y=4k + 1/3.

But I don't know y. Alternatively, perhaps y is another side length, but I don't have information about it.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that y is the length of another side, but without knowing which side, it's impossible.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something in the problem statement. Let me read it again.

The problem states: If polygon ACDF is similar to polygon VWYZ, AF = 12, CD = 9, YZ = 10, YW = 6, and ZV = 3y-1, find the length of FD.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The problem says YW =6, not WY. So YW is 6, which is different from WY.

Wait, that's an important correction. So YW =6. So WY is different from YW.

Wait, in polygon VWYZ, the sides are VW, WY, YZ, ZV.

So, the side after V is W, so VW is the first side, then W to Y is WY, then Y to Z is YZ, then Z to V is ZV.

So, YW is not a side, but perhaps a diagonal? Or maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be WY=6.

Wait, the problem says YW=6. So perhaps that's the length of the diagonal from Y to W. Hmm, but that complicates things because diagonals in similar polygons don't necessarily have the same ratio as sides unless the polygons are regular, which they aren't necessarily.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.

The problem states:

- AF = 12

- CD =9

- YZ=10

- YW=6

- ZV=3y-1

So, YW=6. So, in polygon VWYZ, YW is a diagonal from Y to W, which is a vertex two steps away. So, in the polygon, Y is connected to W via a diagonal, and the length is 6.

Hmm, but in similar polygons, the ratio of corresponding diagonals is the same as the ratio of corresponding sides. So, if YW is a diagonal in VWYZ, then in ACDF, the corresponding diagonal would be from D to C, because the order is A C D F, so D is two steps from C. Wait, no, in ACDF, the vertices are A, C, D, F. So, the diagonals would be AC (but that's a side), CD is a side, DF is a side, FA is a side. Wait, no, the diagonals in a quadrilateral are the connections between non-consecutive vertices. So in ACDF, the diagonals would be AD and CF. Because A is connected to D and C is connected to F.

Wait, but in VWYZ, the diagonal YW connects Y to W, which are two vertices apart. So, in ACDF, the corresponding diagonal would be from D to C, but D and C are consecutive, so that's a side, not a diagonal. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps YW in VWYZ corresponds to DF in ACDF, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the diagonals.

If YW =6 in VWYZ, which is a diagonal, then the corresponding diagonal in ACDF would be DF, since D and F are two vertices apart in ACDF (A, C, D, F). So, the diagonal DF in ACDF corresponds to YW in VWYZ.

So, DF corresponds to YW. So, DF/YW =k.

Given that YW=6 and DF=10/k (from earlier), so:

DF/YW =k → (10/k)/6 =k → (10)/(6k) =k →10=6k² →k²=10/6=5/3 →k=√(5/3) ≈1.291.

Wait, but that seems a bit messy. Let me check the logic.

If YW=6 in VWYZ corresponds to DF in ACDF, then DF = YW *k → DF=6k.

But earlier, I thought DF=10/k because YZ=10 corresponds to DF. Wait, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps YW corresponds to a different diagonal in ACDF.

Wait, in VWYZ, YW is a diagonal from Y to W. In ACDF, the corresponding diagonal would be from D to C, but D and C are consecutive, so that's a side, not a diagonal. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps YW corresponds to AF in ACDF, but AF is a side, not a diagonal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think again.

Given that YW=6, which is a diagonal in VWYZ, and if the polygons are similar, then the ratio of the diagonals is the same as the ratio of the sides.

So, if YW=6 in VWYZ corresponds to a diagonal in ACDF, say, AF=12. Wait, but AF is a side, not a diagonal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps YW corresponds to CF in ACDF, because CF is a diagonal from C to F.

So, if YW=6 corresponds to CF in ACDF, then CF=6k.

But I don't know CF's length. Alternatively, perhaps I can find CF using other information.

Wait, in ACDF, the sides are AC, CD=9, DF, FA=12.

The diagonals are AD and CF.

So, CF is a diagonal from C to F. If CF corresponds to YW=6, then CF=6k.

But I don't know CF's length, so that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps YW corresponds to another diagonal.

Wait, maybe I should give up on this approach and try to find k using the information I have.

From earlier, I have:

- AF=12 corresponds to ZV=3y-1, so 12/(3y-1)=k.

- YW=6 in VWYZ, which may correspond to a diagonal in ACDF, but I'm not sure which one.

Alternatively, perhaps YW=6 corresponds to CD=9, but that's a side, not a diagonal.

Wait, maybe YW=6 is a side, but earlier I thought WY was a side. Wait, in the problem, YW=6, which is different from WY. So, perhaps WY is another side, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to list the sides again.

In VWYZ, the sides are VW, WY, YZ, ZV.

The problem gives YW=6, which is a different side from WY. Wait, no, YW is the same as WY, just the order is reversed. So YW=6 is the same as WY=6.

Wait, that makes more sense. So WY=6.

So, WY=6 in VWYZ corresponds to CD=9 in ACDF.

So, WY=6 corresponds to CD=9, so the scale factor k is 6/9 = 2/3.

Wait, that's a possible approach. So, if WY=6 corresponds to CD=9, then k=WY/CD=6/9=2/3.

So, k=2/3.

Then, the scale factor from ACDF to VWYZ is k=2/3.

So, each side in VWYZ is 2/3 times the corresponding side in ACDF.

Wait, but that would mean that ACDF is larger than VWYZ, which makes sense if k=2/3.

Now, let's check this.

If k=2/3, then ZV=AF *k=12*(2/3)=8.

But the problem states that ZV=3y-1=8 →3y=9→y=3.

So, y=3.

Now, we can find DF, which is YZ/k=10/(2/3)=15.

So, FD=DF=15.

Looking at the options, J is 15.

So, the answer should be J:15.
</think>

The polygons ACDF and VWYZ are similar, meaning their corresponding sides are proportional. Given the correspondence of vertices A→V, C→W, D→Y, F→Z, the sides correspond as follows:

- AC ↔ VW  
- CD ↔ WY  
- DF ↔ YZ  
- FA ↔ ZV  

From the problem, we know:
- CD = 9 corresponds to WY = 6.  
- Therefore, the scale factor \( k = \frac{\text{WY}}{\text{CD}} = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3} \).  

Using this scale factor, we find DF, which corresponds to YZ = 10:  
\[
\text{DF} = \frac{\text{YZ}}{k} = \frac{10}{\frac{2}{3}} = 15
\]

Thus, the length of FD (which is the same as DF) is **15**.
