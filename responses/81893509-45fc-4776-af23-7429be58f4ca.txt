Question:

Which of the following best summarizes why people tend to stay in a slightly elevated state of arousal after a crisis has occurred?

Options:

A: Their neurons continue to fire at a rapid pace, keeping them in a state of high alert.
B: Their neurons remain in a state of graded potentiality even after they have fired.
C: Their heart rate remains elevated due to the stress of the crisis.
D: Their muscles remain tense due to the physical exertion of the crisis.
E: Their pituitary gland continues to release stress hormones.
F: Their bloodstream continues to contain elevated levels of adrenaline.

Answer:

Okay, so I have this question about why people stay in a slightly elevated state of arousal after a crisis. Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that stress responses involve the fight-or-flight reaction. When you're in a crisis, your body releases certain hormones like adrenaline, right?

The question is asking about the reason for the lingering state of arousal. Let me look at the options. Option A says neurons keep firing rapidly. I think once the immediate threat is gone, the firing might slow down, so maybe not A.

Option B talks about neurons remaining in graded potentiality. Graded potentials are like the varying degrees of electrical activity in neurons, but I'm not sure how this directly ties to the arousal state lasting after the crisis. Maybe not the best fit.

Option C is about the heart rate remaining elevated. While stress can cause an increased heart rate, I think the question is more about the underlying cause, like hormones, rather than just heart rate.

Option D mentions muscles staying tense. That makes sense because during a crisis, muscles tense up, and maybe they stay tense a bit after, but again, is that the main reason for the elevated arousal?

Option E refers to the pituitary gland releasing stress hormones. Wait, the pituitary gland actually triggers the release of hormones like ACTH, which then tells the adrenal glands to release cortisol. So maybe E isn't the direct source of the hormones causing the arousal.

Option F says the bloodstream has elevated adrenaline. Adrenaline, or epinephrine, is released during stress and keeps the body in a heightened state. After the crisis, the adrenaline doesn't drop immediately, so it's still in the system, keeping arousal up. That sounds right.

So putting it together, the body releases adrenaline during a crisis, and even after the threat is gone, the adrenaline levels stay high for a while. That keeps people in a slightly elevated state of arousal. So the best answer would be F.

The best answer is F: Their bloodstream continues to contain elevated levels of adrenaline. After a crisis, adrenaline persists in the bloodstream, maintaining a heightened state of arousal.

Answer: F
