Question:

A buyer filed a lawsuit against a seller based on a written contract allegedly executed at the time of the sale of the seller's hot dog stand to the buyer. Under the terms of the contract, the seller agreed not to open a hot dog stand for a period of two years within a distance of two miles of the old hot dog stand, now owned by the buyer. The buyer alleged in his complaint that the seller violated the contract by opening a hot dog stand one-half mile from the old location. The original contract was lost prior to trial. At trial, the buyer wants to introduce a duplicate carbon copy of the written contract. The seller objects as to the authenticity of the original written contract. The copy is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the seller contests the authenticity of the written contract.
B: inadmissible, because the best evidence rule requires that the original contract always be used as evidence.
C: admissible, because the duplicate is a carbon copy.
D: admissible, because the original contract was lost.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically about a written contract and whether a duplicate carbon copy is admissible in court. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: A buyer sued a seller based on a written contract. The contract says the seller won't open another hot dog stand within two miles of the original location for two years. The buyer claims the seller violated this by opening a stand half a mile away. The original contract was lost before trial, so the buyer wants to use a duplicate carbon copy. The seller objects, saying the original isn't authentic.

The question is about the admissibility of that carbon copy. The options are A to D, each giving a reason for why it's admissible or not.

I remember that in evidence law, there are rules about what can be admitted, like the best evidence rule and exceptions to it. The best evidence rule, I think, is from the FRE (Federal Rules of Evidence), Rule 1002. It says that to prove the content of a writing, the original is required unless an exception applies.

So, the buyer is trying to admit a duplicate, a carbon copy, of the lost contract. The seller is objecting, probably on the basis of the best evidence rule because they say the original is missing.

Wait, but the original was lost. So, does that matter? I think the best evidence rule is about whether the original exists and is available. If the original is lost or unavailable, there are exceptions. Like, under Rule 1004, if the original is lost or destroyed, a duplicate is admissible. But I need to check the exact conditions.

Rule 1004 says that a duplicate is admissible if the original is lost or destroyed, provided that the proponent (here, the buyer) shows that the original is unavailable. So, in this case, the original was lost, which would mean the buyer can use the duplicate. But wait, the seller is contesting the authenticity of the original. Does that affect it?

Hmm. The seller's objection is about the authenticity of the original. So, they might argue that even if the original is lost, the duplicate's authenticity is in question because they don't trust that the original was authentic. But under the rules, the issue is whether the original exists, not necessarily whether it's authentic. The best evidence rule requires the original unless an exception applies. So, if the original is lost, the duplicate can be admitted.

Wait, but another point: the best evidence rule isn't about whether the evidence is the best, but about whether the content of a writing is proved by the original. So, the main issue here is whether the duplicate is admissible under the exceptions.

So, looking at the options:

A: Inadmissible because seller contests authenticity. I don't think that's right because the best evidence rule isn't about the content's truth but about the method of proving it. So the seller's contest about authenticity doesn't make the duplicate inadmissible; it might go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.

B: Inadmissible because best evidence requires the original. But the original is lost, so under 1004, the duplicate is admissible. So B is wrong.

C: Admissible because it's a carbon copy. Wait, carbon copies are considered duplicates. So under 1004, if the original is unavailable, a duplicate is okay. So the reason here would be that the original was lost, so the duplicate is allowed. So C might be correct, but I'm not sure if the reasoning is the best because the main reason is the loss, not just being a carbon copy.

D: Admissible because the original was lost. Yes, that seems correct because under 1004, the loss of the original allows the use of a duplicate.

Wait, but what about the seller's objection about the authenticity of the original? If the original was lost, the duplicate is admissible, but the opposing party can still challenge the authenticity of the copy. But in this question, the issue is whether the copy is admissible, not whether it's reliable. So the court would allow the copy in, but the seller can argue about its authenticity.

So the correct reasoning is that the original was lost, so the duplicate is admissible under 1004.

Looking back at the options, D says "admissible because the original was lost." That seems right. C says it's admissible because it's a carbon copy, but the main reason is the loss, not just being a carbon copy. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people think that any duplicate is okay, but the key is the loss of the original. So, yes, D is the correct choice.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a duplicate carbon copy of a lost written contract under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The best evidence rule (FRE 1002) generally requires the original document to prove its content, but exceptions exist. Under FRE 1004, a duplicate is admissible if the original is lost or destroyed, provided the proponent can show the original's unavailability. Here, the original contract was lost, making the duplicate admissible. The seller's objection to the original's authenticity does not affect the admissibility of the duplicate; it may impact the evidence's weight but not its admissibility. Therefore, the correct answer is based on the loss of the original, not the nature of the duplicate as a carbon copy.
