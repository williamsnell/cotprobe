Question:

A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of severe epigastric pain and vomiting. Past medical history is negative for any similar episodes. He does not take any medications. He smokes cigarettes, has a 40 pack-year history, and consumes more than 8 cans of beer per day. Abdominal examination reveals epigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies reveal a serum amylase level of 467 U/L (reference range: 28-100 U/L) and a γ-glutamyltransferase level of 212 U/L (reference range: < 55 U/L). Referred pain in this patient is transmitted to the spinal cord by which of the following nerves?

Options:

A: anterior rami of C1-C5
B: anterior rami of T11-T12
C: anterior rami of L1-L5
D: posterior rami of T6-T10
E: posterior rami of L1-L5
F: posterior rami of T11-T12
G: anterior rami of T6-T10
H: anterior rami of T1-T5
I: anterior rami of C6-C10
J: posterior rami of T1-T5

Alright, let's tackle this question step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it carefully.

So, the patient is a 55-year-old man with severe epigastric pain and vomiting for two days. His past medical history is clean, no similar episodes before. He smokes and drinks a lot of beer, which might be relevant. The physical exam shows epigastric tenderness. The lab results show elevated serum amylase (467 U/L, which is way above the normal range of 28-100) and high γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) at 212 U/L, which is above the normal of <55.

First, I need to consider what's causing his symptoms. The elevated amylase and GGT suggest pancreatic issues. Amylase is often elevated in pancreatitis, and GGT is associated with liver or biliary issues, but in this case, since it's acute, pancreatitis seems more likely, especially given the pain and vomiting.

Now, the question is about the referred pain and which nerves transmit it to the spinal cord. So, the key here is understanding where the pain is coming from and which nerves are responsible for that area.

Epigastric pain is typically associated with the upper abdomen, around the area of the pancreas, which is in the retroperitoneum. The pancreas is located behind the stomach, near the duodenum. When the pancreas is inflamed (pancreatitis), it can cause pain that's transmitted through specific nerves.

I remember that the upper abdominal area, including the epigastric region, is innervated by the thoracic spinal nerves. Specifically, the T6 to T10 region. Wait, let me think again. The epigastric area is innervated by the anterior rami of T6 to T10. Because the anterior rami (also called the ventral ramus) are responsible for conveying sensory information from the skin and organs to the spinal cord.

So, when the pancreas is inflamed, the pain signals travel through these nerves. The posterior rami are involved in conveying sensory information from the skin and some deeper tissues, but the internal organs like the pancreas would be more associated with the anterior rami.

Looking at the options, the ones that are anterior rami include options A, G, H, I. The options with posterior rami are D, E, F, J.

Since the question is about referred pain from the pancreas, the correct nerves should be the anterior rami of T6-T10. That would correspond to option G, which is anterior rami of T6-T10.

Wait, let me double-check. The pancreas is in the retroperitoneum, and its innervation is from the prevertebral plexus, which is derived from the anterior rami of T5 to T9. So, the pain would be referred along these nerves. That aligns with T6-T10 being the range.

So, the correct answer should be option G: anterior rami of T6-T10.

The patient presents with severe epigastric pain and vomiting, along with elevated serum amylase and γ-glutamyltransferase levels, suggesting pancreatitis. The epigastric region is innervated by the anterior rami of the thoracic spinal nerves T6 to T10, which transmit sensory information from internal organs like the pancreas to the spinal cord. Therefore, the referred pain in this patient is transmitted by the anterior rami of T6-T10.

Answer: G
