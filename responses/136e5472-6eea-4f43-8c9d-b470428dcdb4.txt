Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the number of days required for $1,640 to earn $6.56 in interest at a 4% rate. Hmm, alright, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula, which is I = P * r * t. Where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time in years. But wait, the options here are in days, so I'll probably need to convert the time from years to days.

Let me write down what I know:
- Principal (P) = $1,640
- Interest (I) = $6.56
- Rate (r) = 4% per year, which is 0.04 in decimal.
- Time (t) = ? days

So, the formula is I = P * r * t. I need to solve for t. Rearranging the formula, t = I / (P * r). 

Plugging in the numbers:
t = 6.56 / (1640 * 0.04).

Let me calculate the denominator first. 1640 * 0.04. Hmm, 1640 * 0.04 is the same as 1640 * 4 / 100. Let's see, 1640 * 4 = 6560, divided by 100 is 65.6. So the denominator is 65.6.

Now, t = 6.56 / 65.6. Let me do that division. 6.56 divided by 65.6. Hmm, 65.6 goes into 6.56 how many times? Well, 65.6 * 0.1 is 6.56, so that means t is 0.1 years.

But wait, the question asks for days. There are 365 days in a year, so t in days is 0.1 * 365. Let me calculate that. 0.1 times 365 is 36.5 days. Hmm, so approximately 36.5 days. Looking at the options, the closest one is B: 36 days.

Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I messed up somewhere.

Starting again, I = P * r * t. So t = I / (P * r). 

P is 1640, r is 0.04, so P*r is 1640*0.04. Let me compute that again. 1640 * 0.04: 1600*0.04 is 64, and 40*0.04 is 1.6, so total is 64 + 1.6 = 65.6. Correct.

Then I is 6.56, so t = 6.56 / 65.6. 6.56 divided by 65.6. Since 65.6 * 0.1 = 6.56, that's correct. So t is 0.1 years.

0.1 years is 36.5 days because 0.1 * 365 = 36.5. So 36.5 days, which is about 36 or 37 days. The options given are 36 days (B) and 30 days (H), 28 (F), etc. So 36 days is the closest. 

Wait, but sometimes in finance, they might use 360 days a year for calculations. Let me check that possibility. If so, t would be 0.1 * 360 = 36 days. So either way, it's 36 days. So the answer should be B: 36 days.

The number of days required is approximately 36 days.
