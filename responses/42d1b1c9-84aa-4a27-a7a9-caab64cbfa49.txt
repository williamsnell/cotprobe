Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about a discounted note, and I need to figure out the proceeds. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the note is a 3-month note for $850 with an interest rate of 6%. It was discounted at 6% a month after it was issued. Hmm, wait, so it's a 3-month note, and it's discounted after one month. So the discounting happens after the first month, right?

First, I should probably figure out how much interest is due each month. Since the note is for 3 months and the interest rate is 6%, that's an annual rate. But wait, is it 6% per annum or 6% per month? Oh, wait, no, because usually, when they say a note bears interest at 6%, it's per annum unless stated otherwise. So I think the interest rate is 6% annually.

But then, the discounting is at 6% per month. Wait, that's a high rate. So the discounting rate is 6% per month, which is 72% annually, which seems high, but maybe that's the case here.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The note itself has a 6% interest rate, and it's being discounted at 6% per month after one month. So perhaps the discount rate is 6% per month. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly.

So the note is for 3 months, $850, 6% annual interest. It's discounted at 6% per month after one month. So the discount is applied after one month, which is 2 months before maturity.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of simple interest. The note is discounted after one month, so the time from discounting to maturity is 2 months. So the discount is calculated on the face value for 2 months at 6% per month.

Wait, but let me think again. The note is issued, and then after one month, it's discounted. So the person gets the proceeds after one month, and the note is then held by the bank or whoever discounted it for the remaining two months.

So the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount for the remaining period. So the discount is for two months at 6% per month on the $850.

Wait, but wait—that's if the discount is applied at the time of discounting. So the proceeds are calculated as the present value of the note at the time of discounting. Since the note is discounted after one month, the time left is two months. So the proceeds would be $850 minus the discount for two months.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the discount as the interest for two months at 6% per month on $850. So each month, the discount is 6% of $850.

Wait, so 6% per month is 0.06 per month. So for two months, the discount would be 0.06 * 2 = 0.12, so 12% of $850. That would be 850 * 0.12 = $102. So the proceeds would be $850 - $102 = $748. But that's not one of the options. Hmm, maybe I'm doing something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the discounting process. Maybe the discount is calculated on the maturity value, not the face value. Let me think again.

The note has a face value of $850 and is for 3 months at 6% annual interest. So the maturity value would be $850 plus interest for 3 months. The interest for three months at 6% per annum is (6/12) * 850 = 42.5. So the maturity value is $850 + $42.50 = $892.50.

But the note is discounted after one month. So at that point, the time remaining is two months. The discount is calculated on the maturity value for two months at 6% per month. Wait, but 6% per month is a high rate, so two months would be 12% of $892.50.

So discount amount is 0.12 * 892.50 = $107.10. Then the proceeds would be 892.50 - 107.10 = $785.40. But that's not an option either. Hmm, this isn't matching any of the options provided. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the discount based on the face value for the remaining time. So the discount rate is 6% per month, and the time is two months, so discount is 6% * 2 = 12% of $850.

So 850 * 0.12 = $102. So proceeds would be 850 - 102 = $748. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the discount is calculated on the face value for one month, since the discounting occurs a month after issue. No, that doesn't make sense because the time from discounting to maturity is two months, so the discount should be for two months.

Alternatively, maybe the discounting rate is 6% annually, not monthly. But the question says it's discounted at 6% a month after it was issued. Hmm, maybe the 6% is the monthly discount rate.

Wait, if the discount rate is 6% per month, then for two months, it's 6% * 2 = 12% of $850, which is $102, so proceeds are $748. Not in options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the discount is calculated using simple interest for the remaining period at the discount rate. So the formula is:

Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value * discount rate * time)

So discount rate is 6% per month, time is 2 months.

So discount = 850 * 0.06 * 2 = 850 * 0.12 = $102. Proceeds = 850 - 102 = $748. Still not matching.

Looking at the options, none of them are close to $748. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the note was discounted at 6% annual, not monthly. Let me try that.

So discount rate is 6% per annum. Time remaining is two months, which is 2/12 = 1/6 year.

So discount = 850 * 0.06 * (2/12) = 850 * 0.06 * (1/6) = 850 * 0.01 = $8.50.

Proceeds = 850 - 8.50 = $841.50. Not in options either.

Wait, the options include $842.30, which is close. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated on the maturity value, not the face value. Let me compute that.

Maturity value is 850 + interest for 3 months. The interest for 3 months at 6% per annum is 850 * 0.06 * (3/12) = 850 * 0.015 = $12.75. So maturity value is $862.75.

Then, the discount is for two months at 6% per month on $862.75.

So discount per month is 862.75 * 0.06 = $51.765. For two months, 51.765 * 2 = $103.53.

Proceeds would be 862.75 - 103.53 = $759.22. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the discount is calculated as 6% per annum, so 6% for two months would be 6/12 * 2 = 10% of the maturity value.

Wait, no, that's not right. 6% per annum is 0.5% per month. So two months would be 1% of $862.75, which is $8.6275. So proceeds would be 862.75 - 8.6275 = $854.12. Hmm, that's option E.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because the discount rate is 6% per month, as the problem states it was discounted at 6% a month after issue.

Wait, the problem says: "discounted at 6% a month after it was issued." So perhaps the discount rate is 6% per month. So for two months, it's 12% of the face value.

So discount is 850 * 0.12 = $102. Proceeds = 850 - 102 = $748. But that's not an option. So maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the interest for the three months first. So the note is for 3 months, 6% annual interest, so interest is 850 * 0.06 * (3/12) = $12.75. So maturity value is $862.75.

Then, the discounting occurs after one month. So the time from discounting to maturity is two months. The discount rate is 6% per month, so the discount is 862.75 * 0.06 * 2 = 862.75 * 0.12 = $103.53. So proceeds are 862.75 - 103.53 = $759.22. Not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the discount is calculated on the face value for two months. So 850 * 0.06 * 2 = $102. So proceeds are $850 - $102 = $748. Still not matching.

Wait, maybe the discount rate is 6% per annum, so 0.5% per month. So two months would be 1% of $850, which is $8.50. Proceeds would be $841.50. Closest option is C: $842.30. Hmm, but that's not exact.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated on the discounted amount. Wait, maybe I should use the present value formula.

The proceeds P = Face Value * (1 + r)^-n, where r is the discount rate per period, and n is the number of periods.

If the discount rate is 6% per month, then for two months, P = 850 * (1 + 0.06)^-2.

Calculate (1.06)^-2. Let me compute that. 1.06 squared is 1.1236. So 1/1.1236 ≈ 0.8907. So P ≈ 850 * 0.8907 ≈ $757.595. Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, if the discount rate is 6% per annum, then per month it's 0.5%. So for two months, P = 850 * (1 + 0.005)^-2. 1.005 squared is about 1.010025, so 1/1.010025 ≈ 0.99007. So P ≈ 850 * 0.99007 ≈ $841.56. Closest to option C: $842.30.

Wait, but the options don't have $841.56. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the discount is calculated on the maturity value, which is $862.75, at 6% per month for two months.

So discount is 862.75 * 0.06 * 2 = 103.53. So proceeds are 862.75 - 103.53 = $759.22. Not matching.

Alternatively, using present value formula: P = 862.75 / (1.06)^2 = 862.75 / 1.1236 ≈ 768. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the discount rate is 6% per annum, so for two months, it's 6% * (2/12) = 1%. So discount is 850 * 0.01 = $8.50. Proceeds = 850 - 8.50 = $841.50. Closest to option C: $842.30.

Alternatively, maybe the discount is calculated on the maturity value, which is $862.75, at 6% per annum for two months. So discount is 862.75 * 0.06 * (2/12) = 862.75 * 0.01 = $8.6275. So proceeds = 862.75 - 8.6275 ≈ $854.12. That's option E.

Wait, so that would make the proceeds $854.12, which is option E. But earlier I thought that discount rate was 6% per month, but perhaps it's 6% per annum.

Wait, the problem says it was discounted at 6% a month after it was issued. So maybe the discount rate is 6% per annum, and the time is two months. So discount is 862.75 * 0.06 * (2/12) = 862.75 * 0.01 = $8.63. So proceeds = 862.75 - 8.63 = $854.12. Which is option E.

Wait, but option F is $8.63, which is the discount amount. So the proceeds would be $854.12, which is option E.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated on the face value, not the maturity value. So discount is 850 * 0.06 * (2/12) = 850 * 0.01 = $8.50. Proceeds = 850 - 8.50 = $841.50. Closest is option C: $842.30.

Hmm, I'm getting conflicting possibilities here. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 850

B: 855.50

C: 842.30

D:856.75

E:854.12

F:8.63

G:860

H:862.75

I:848.25

J:847.50

So if the discount is $8.63, the proceeds would be $854.12, which is option E. Alternatively, if the discount is $8.50, proceeds would be $841.50, close to C: $842.30.

But which approach is correct? Let me think again.

The note is a 3-month note with 6% annual interest. So the interest for 3 months is $12.75, making the maturity value $862.75.

It's discounted at 6% a month after issue, so after one month, two months remain.

If the discount is applied on the maturity value at 6% per annum for two months, then discount is 862.75 * 0.06 * (2/12) = 862.75 * 0.01 = $8.6275. So proceeds are 862.75 - 8.6275 ≈ $854.12, which is option E.

Alternatively, if the discount is 6% per month, then for two months, it's 12% discount on maturity value: 862.75 * 0.12 = $103.53, proceeds $759.22, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, discount on face value at 6% per month for two months: 850 * 0.12 = $102, proceeds $748, not an option.

So the only option that makes sense is E: $854.12.

Wait, but the problem says it's discounted at 6% a month after it was issued. The phrasing is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean the discount rate is 6% per month, or that the discounting occurs at 6% after one month?

If the discount rate is 6% per month, then the calculation would be as above, but that would give proceeds not matching the options. But if the discount rate is 6% per annum, then it works out to E.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated using the simple interest formula for the time from discounting to maturity.

So, discount = face value * rate * time.

If the discount rate is 6% per annum, then rate is 0.06, time is 2 months, which is 2/12 = 1/6.

So discount = 850 * 0.06 * (2/12) = 850 * 0.01 = $8.50. Proceeds = 850 - 8.50 = $841.50. Closest to C: $842.30.

But then, why would the discount be on face value? Or is it on the maturity value?

Wait, perhaps the discount is calculated on the maturity value, which is $862.75, using the discount rate of 6% per annum for two months.

So discount = 862.75 * 0.06 * (2/12) = 862.75 * 0.01 = $8.6275. So proceeds are 862.75 - 8.6275 = $854.12, which is option E.

That seems more accurate because the discount is usually applied to the maturity value.

So the correct answer would be E: $854.12.
</think>

The correct answer is E: $854.12.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Determine Maturity Value:**
   - The note is for 3 months at 6% annual interest.
   - Interest for 3 months: \( 850 \times 0.06 \times \frac{3}{12} = 12.75 \).
   - Maturity value: \( 850 + 12.75 = 862.75 \).

2. **Discounting After One Month:**
   - The note is discounted after one month, leaving 2 months until maturity.
   - The discount rate is 6% per annum, so for 2 months: \( 0.06 \times \frac{2}{12} = 0.01 \) (1%).

3. **Calculate Discount Amount:**
   - Discount on maturity value: \( 862.75 \times 0.01 = 8.6275 \).

4. **Determine Proceeds:**
   - Proceeds = Maturity value - Discount: \( 862.75 - 8.6275 = 854.12 \).

**Answer:** E
