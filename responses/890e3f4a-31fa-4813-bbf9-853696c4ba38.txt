Alright, so I have this problem about calculating the entropy H(X₁, X₂, …, X₅₂) where each X_i represents the color of the ith card in a shuffled deck. The deck has 26 red and 26 black cards, and we're dealing them without replacement. The question is asking me to compute this entropy in bits, and there are several multiple-choice options provided.

First, I need to understand what entropy means in this context. Entropy, in information theory, is a measure of the uncertainty or randomness in a set of data. For a single random variable, the entropy H(X) is calculated using the formula H(X) = -Σ p_i log₂ p_i, where p_i are the probabilities of each outcome. But here, we're dealing with multiple variables—specifically, 52 variables—each representing the color of a card at each position.

Wait, but wait, in this problem, each X_i is the color of the ith card. So the entire sequence of X₁ to X₅₂ is the entire deck's color sequence. The entropy H(X₁, X₂, …, X₅₂) would then be the entropy of the entire sequence. But I'm a bit confused because entropy is usually calculated for individual variables, but when dealing with multiple variables, it's the joint entropy. So H(X₁, X₂, …, X₅₂) is the joint entropy of all these variables.

But wait, for a sequence of dependent variables, the joint entropy would be the sum of the entropies of each variable plus the sum of all their mutual information terms. But that seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to think about this.

Alternatively, considering that the deck is shuffled uniformly, the entire sequence is equally likely to be any permutation of red and black cards. So the entropy of the entire sequence could be thought of in terms of the number of possible sequences and the probability of each.

The total number of possible sequences is the number of ways to arrange 26 red and 26 black cards. That's the combination C(52,26), which is 52!/(26!26!). The entropy H would then be log₂ of that number, because entropy is the logarithm of the number of possible outcomes when each is equally probable.

Wait, wait, but that's the entropy if all sequences are equally likely. But in this case, each possible sequence is equally likely because the deck is shuffled uniformly at random. So the number of possible sequences is C(52,26), and each has probability 1/C(52,26). Therefore, the entropy H would be log₂(C(52,26)).

Let me calculate that. First, I need to compute log₂(52!/(26!26!)).

But calculating factorials for 52 is going to be a bit messy. Maybe I can use Stirling's approximation for factorials. Stirling's formula is n! ≈ sqrt(2πn) (n/e)^n. Let's apply that.

So, 52! ≈ sqrt(2π*52) * (52/e)^52.
Similarly, 26! ≈ sqrt(2π*26) * (26/e)^26.

So, 52!/(26!26!) ≈ [sqrt(2π*52) * (52/e)^52] / [ (sqrt(2π*26))^2 * (26/e)^52 ) ]

Simplify the denominator: sqrt(2π*26) squared is 2π*26.

So:

= [sqrt(2π*52) * (52^52)/(e^52) ] / [ (2π*26) * (26^52)/(e^52) ) ]

The e^52 terms cancel out.

Now, let's compute the terms:

sqrt(2π*52) = sqrt(104π) ≈ sqrt(325.663) ≈ 18.05.

Denominator's sqrt(2π*26) is sqrt(52π) ≈ sqrt(163.362) ≈ 12.78.

Wait, but in the denominator, I have (2π*26) which is 52π, so sqrt(52π) is approximately 12.78. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the denominator calculation.

Wait, the denominator is (sqrt(2π*26))^2, which is 2π*26. So denominator is 2π*26.

So the entire expression becomes:

= [sqrt(2π*52) * (52^52)] / [ (2π*26) * (26^52) ) ]

We can write 52^52 as (2*26)^52 = 2^52 * 26^52.

So,

= [sqrt(104π) * 2^52 * 26^52 ] / [ (52π) * 26^52 ) ]

The 26^52 cancels out.

So:

= [sqrt(104π) * 2^52 ] / (52π)

Simplify 52 as 2*26.

So:

= [sqrt(104π) * 2^52 ] / (2*26 * π )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

sqrt(104π) = sqrt(4*26π) = 2*sqrt(26π).

So:

= [2*sqrt(26π) * 2^52 ] / (2*26 * π )

The 2 in numerator and denominator cancels.

= [sqrt(26π) * 2^52 ] / (26 π )

Simplify sqrt(26π) as (26π)^(1/2), so:

= [ (26π)^(1/2) * 2^52 ] / (26 π )

Which is:

= [2^52 * (26π)^(1/2) ] / (26 π )

= 2^52 / (26^(1/2) * π^(1/2) )

Wait, because (26π)^(1/2) is sqrt(26π), and denominator is 26π, so [sqrt(26π)]/(26π) = 1/(sqrt(26π)).

So,

= 2^52 / sqrt(26π)

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check.

Wait, original expression after substitution:

= [sqrt(104π) * 2^52 ] / (52π)

But 52=4*13, perhaps it's better to write as 4*13.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute log₂(C(52,26)) using logarithms without approximating.

Another approach: H = log₂(C(52,26)).

We can compute this using logarithms.

We know that C(52,26) = 52!/(26!26!) 

Taking the log base 2:

log₂(C(52,26)) = log₂(52!) - 2 log₂(26!) 

Using Stirling's approximation for log(n!) ≈ n log n - n + (1/2) log(2πn)

So,

log₂(52!) ≈ (52 ln 52 - 52) / ln 2 + (1/2) log₂(2π*52) 

Similarly,

log₂(26!) ≈ (26 ln26 -26)/ln2 + (1/2) log₂(2π*26)

So,

log₂(C(52,26)) ≈ [ (52 ln52 -52)/ln2 + 0.5 log₂(104π) ] - 2*[ (26 ln26 -26)/ln2 + 0.5 log₂(52π) ]

Simplify this:

= [52 ln52 -52 - 2*(26 ln26 -26)] / ln2 + [ 0.5 log₂(104π) - 2*0.5 log₂(52π) ]

Let's compute each part step by step.

First, the terms without logs:

52 ln52 -52 -2*(26 ln26 -26) 

=52 ln52 -52 -52 ln26 +52 

=52 (ln52 - ln26) 

Because -52 +52 cancels.

=52 ln(52/26) =52 ln2 ≈52 *0.6931 ≈52 *0.6931=36.0412

Now, the denominator is ln2, so this part is 36.0412 / 0.6931 ≈52.

Wait, that's interesting. So the first part is 52.

Now the second part:

0.5 log₂(104π) - 2*0.5 log₂(52π) 

= 0.5 log₂(104π) - log₂(52π)

= 0.5 [ log₂(104π) ] - log₂(52π)

We can factor this as:

= log₂( (104π)^0.5 ) - log₂(52π) 

= log₂( (104π)^0.5 / (52π) )

Simplify inside the log:

(104π)^0.5 / (52π) = sqrt(104π) / (52π) 

= sqrt(104π) / (52π) 

= sqrt(104)/(52 sqrt(π)) 

Wait, because sqrt(104π) is sqrt(104)*sqrt(π), and denominator is 52π.

So,

= sqrt(104) / (52 sqrt(π)) 

But sqrt(104)=sqrt(4*26)=2*sqrt(26), so:

= 2 sqrt(26) / (52 sqrt(π)) )

= sqrt(26)/(26 sqrt(π)) )

= (sqrt(26)/(26)) * (1/sqrt(π)) )

= (1/sqrt(26)) * (1/sqrt(π)) )

= 1/(sqrt(26π)) )

So the second part is log₂(1/(sqrt(26π))) )= - log₂(sqrt(26π)) )= -0.5 log₂(26π)

Because sqrt(x) is x^(1/2), so log(x^(1/2))=0.5 log x.

So, putting it all together, the second part is -0.5 log₂(26π).

Now, putting both parts together:

H ≈ [52 / ln2 ] + [ - 0.5 log₂(26π) ]

Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.

Wait, the first part after substitution was 52, because 52 ln2 ≈52 *0.6931 ≈36.0412, and 36.0412/0.6931≈52.

So, the first part is 52.

The second part is -0.5 log₂(26π). Let me compute that numerically.

Compute log₂(26π):

26 ≈26, π≈3.1416, so 26π≈81.681.

log₂(81.681)= ln(81.681)/ln2≈4.403 /0.6931≈6.35.

So, 0.5 * 6.35≈3.175.

So, the second part is -3.175.

So, H≈52 -3.175≈48.825 bits.

Looking at the options, option I is 48.8, which matches closely.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me check if I made any miscalculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator to compute log₂(C(52,26)) more accurately.

But I don't have a calculator here, but I can approximate.

Another way: the entropy of the entire sequence is the same as the entropy of the deck's configuration, which is log₂(C(52,26)).

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Since each shuffle is equally likely, the entropy is the maximum possible, which is log₂ of the number of possible sequences, which is C(52,26).

But I think my earlier approximation using Stirling's formula gave me around 48.8 bits, which is option I:48.8.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 52 bits because each position is a binary choice, but that's not correct because the choices are dependent (since we have exactly 26 red and 26 black cards).

Wait, if all positions were independent, the entropy would be 52 bits because each card is either red or black, each with probability 0.5, so each contributes 1 bit, and 52*1=52. But in reality, they are not independent because the total number of red and black cards is fixed. So the entropy should be less than 52.

Wait, but according to my calculation, it's about 48.8, which is less than 52, which makes sense.

Wait, but let me think again: the entropy of the entire sequence is the entropy of all the bits together, which is the same as the entropy of the entire permutation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as the entropy of the entire deck, which is the sum of the entropy of each position given the previous ones.

Wait, but that approach would involve H = sum_{i=1 to 52} H(X_i | X_{i-1}, ..., X_1})

But that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the entropy is equal to the entropy of the entire deck, which is H = log₂(C(52,26)) ≈ 48.8 bits, which is option I.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Let me see: I had 52 ln52 -52 -2*(26 ln26 -26) =52 (ln52 - ln26)=52 ln2≈52 * 0.6931=36.0412. Then, 36.0412 / ln2≈52, which seems correct.

Then the second part was about -3.175, so total H≈52-3.175≈48.825.

So the answer should be 48.8, which is option I.
</think>

The entropy of the entire sequence of card colors is calculated as the logarithm base 2 of the number of possible sequences, which is the combination C(52,26). Using Stirling's approximation, this entropy is found to be approximately 48.8 bits.
