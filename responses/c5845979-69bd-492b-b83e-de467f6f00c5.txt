Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is: Six 6-sided dice are rolled. What's the probability that three of the dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers? The options are labeled A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, first, I think I need to break down the problem into smaller parts. Probability problems often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to find both the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six dice and the number of favorable outcomes where exactly three dice show prime numbers and the other three show composite numbers.

Let me start with the basics. A standard 6-sided die has the numbers 1 through 6. I remember that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, let's list them out: 2, 3, and 5. Wait, is 1 considered prime? No, I think 1 is neither prime nor composite. So, the primes on the die are 2, 3, and 5. That's three numbers.

Now, composite numbers are numbers greater than 1 that are not prime, meaning they have more than two factors. Let's see, on a die, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. We've already identified 2, 3, 5 as primes. So, the composite numbers are 4 and 6. Wait, but what about 1? Since 1 is neither, it's not composite. So, the composite numbers on a die are 4 and 6. That's two numbers.

Wait, hold on, that's only two composite numbers. So, on each die, the probability of rolling a prime is 3 out of 6, or 1/2. The probability of rolling a composite is 2 out of 6, which simplifies to 1/3. But wait, what about the number 1? It's not included in either primes or composites, so if a die shows 1, it's neither. Hmm, but the problem says that three dice show primes and the rest show composites. Does that mean that the other three must show composites, and no dice show 1? Because 1 isn't composite, right?

Wait, that's an important point. Because the problem states that three are primes and the rest are composites, that implies that all six dice must show either a prime or a composite. So, the number 1 can't appear in this scenario. So, when calculating the favorable outcomes, we have to ensure that each die shows either a prime or a composite. So, in other words, each die must show either 2,3,5 (primes) or 4,6 (composites). So, each die has 3 + 2 = 5 valid outcomes. But wait, that's not correct because 1 is a possible outcome, but in this problem, it's excluded because we're considering only primes and composites. So, perhaps I need to adjust the probabilities accordingly.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this as a binomial probability problem, but with some adjustments because each die has different probabilities for primes and composites.

So, first, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six dice is 6^6, which is 46656. That's the denominator for our probability calculation.

Now, the numerator is the number of favorable outcomes where exactly three dice show primes and the other three show composites. But wait, each die has 3 primes (2,3,5) and 2 composites (4,6). So, for each die, the probability of rolling a prime is 3/6 = 1/2, and a composite is 2/6 = 1/3.

Wait, but the problem is about the number of favorable outcomes, not probabilities yet. So, for each die, the number of ways to get a prime is 3, and a composite is 2.

Since we need exactly three primes and three composites across six dice, the number of favorable outcomes is calculated using combinations. The number of ways to choose which three dice show primes is C(6,3). For each of those three dice, there are 3 possible outcomes (primes), and for the other three dice, there are 2 possible outcomes (composites).

So, the number of favorable outcomes would be C(6,3) * (3^3) * (2^3).

Let me compute that step by step.

C(6,3) is the combination of 6 things taken 3 at a time. The formula is 6! / (3! * (6-3)!)) = (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20.

Then, 3^3 is 27, and 2^3 is 8. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 20 * 27 * 8.

Wait, 20 * 27 is 540, and 540 * 8 is 4320.

So, the number of favorable outcomes is 4320, and the total number of possible outcomes is 6^6, which is 46656.

So, the probability is 4320 / 46656.

Now, let's simplify that fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 4320: 4320 ÷ 4320 = 1. 46656 ÷ 4320 = let's see, 4320 * 10 = 43200, which is less than 46656. 46656 - 43200 = 3456. So, 10 + (3456/4320). Simplify 3456/4320: both can be divided by 432. 3456 ÷ 432 = 8, and 4320 ÷ 432 = 10. So, 8/10 = 4/5. So, total is 10 + 4/5 = 10.8, which is 54/5. Wait, that can't be right because the denominator should be larger than the numerator.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simplifying. Let me try another approach. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 4320.

Wait, 4320 * 10 = 43200, which is less than 46656 by 3456. So, 46656 ÷ 4320 = 10.8, which is 54/5, but that's not right because 54/5 is 10.8, but the denominator is 46656, which is 6^6.

Alternatively, let's factor both numerator and denominator.

4320 = 2^5 * 3^3.

46656 = 6^6 = (2*3)^6 = 2^6 * 3^6.

So, the fraction is (2^5 * 3^3) / (2^6 * 3^6) = (1/2) * (1/3^3) = (1/2) * (1/27) = 1/54.

Wait, that seems off because 4320/46656 = 1/10.8, which is approximately 0.0926, and 1/54 is approximately 0.0185, which is much smaller. So, I must have made a mistake in the simplification.

Wait, let's compute 4320 ÷ 46656.

Divide numerator and denominator by 4320: 4320 ÷ 4320 = 1; 46656 ÷ 4320 = let's compute 46656 ÷ 4320.

Divide numerator and denominator by 4320:

4320 × 10 = 43200

46656 - 43200 = 3456

So, 46656 ÷ 4320 = 10 + 3456/4320.

Simplify 3456/4320: both divisible by 432. 3456 ÷ 432 = 8; 4320 ÷ 432 = 10. So, 8/10 = 4/5.

Thus, 46656 ÷ 4320 = 10 + 4/5 = 10.8, which is 54/5. So, 4320/46656 = 1/(54/5) )= 5/54.

So, the probability is 5/54.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 5/54, option H is 10/54, which simplifies to 5/27, which is higher.

Wait, but according to my calculation, it's 5/54. So, that would be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the number of favorable outcomes is C(6,3) * (3^3) * (2^3) = 20 * 27 * 8 = 4320.

Total possible outcomes: 6^6 = 46656.

So, 4320/46656 = ?

Let me compute 46656 ÷ 4320.

Well, 4320 × 10 = 43200, as before. 46656 - 43200 = 3456.

Now, 4320 × 0.8 = 3456 (because 4320 × 0.8 = 3456).

So, 4320 × 10.8 = 46656.

Thus, 4320 is 1/10.8 of 46656. 1/10.8 is the same as 10/108, which reduces to 5/54.

Yes, that's correct. So, the probability is 5/54, which is option B.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think again about the initial setup. Each die has 3 primes and 2 composites. That's correct. So, the number of primes per die is 3, composites 2. So, the number of favorable outcomes for each die is 3 (primes) and 2 (composites). So, for three primes and three composites, it's C(6,3) * (3^3) * (2^3). That's correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is using the binomial probability formula, considering each die as an independent trial with two possible outcomes: success (prime) or failure (composite). But wait, in this case, the probability of success isn't the same as the probability of failure because the number of primes and composites aren't the same. So, perhaps using the binomial formula isn't directly applicable here.

Wait, but let me try that approach. The probability of getting exactly k successes (primes) in n trials (dice rolls) is C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where p is the probability of success on a single trial.

In this case, p is the probability of rolling a prime, which is 3/6 = 1/2. So, p = 1/2, and the probability of failure (composite) is 2/6 = 1/3. Wait, but that's a problem because in the binomial formula, the probability of failure is (1-p), which would be 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. But in reality, the probability of composite is 1/3, which is less than 1/2. So, the binomial formula isn't directly applicable here because the two outcomes (prime and composite) don't have the same probability. Therefore, it's better to model it as a multinomial distribution, considering the two possible outcomes with different probabilities.

Wait, but in our case, we're only considering two outcomes: prime or composite. So, perhaps the correct approach is to model it as a binomial with different probabilities for success and failure.

Wait, so in each trial (die roll), the probability of success (prime) is 1/2, and the probability of failure (composite) is 1/3. But wait, the sum of these is 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6, which is less than 1. So, that leaves a 1/6 probability of rolling a 1, which is neither prime nor composite. But in our problem, we're given that all dice must show either prime or composite, so we have to adjust our probabilities accordingly.

Hmm, so perhaps another approach is to consider that, given that each die must show either a prime or a composite, the probability of each die showing a prime is 3/5, and composite is 2/5. Because, excluding 1, there are 5 possible outcomes (3 primes and 2 composites) out of 6. So, the conditional probability that a die shows a prime given that it's either prime or composite is 3/5, and similarly for composite, it's 2/5.

So, in that case, the probability of exactly three primes and three composites would be C(6,3) * (3/5)^3 * (2/5)^3.

Let me compute that.

C(6,3) is 20.

(3/5)^3 = 27/125.

(2/5)^3 = 8/125.

Multiplying these together: 20 * (27/125) * (8/125) = 20 * (216/15625) = (4320)/15625.

Wait, but that's a fraction, but let me compute it as a decimal to see if it matches any of the options.

4320 ÷ 15625 ≈ 0.27648.

But wait, earlier when I considered the total possible outcomes as 6^6, I got 5/54 ≈ 0.0926. These two numbers are different, so I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, the confusion arises because in the first approach, I considered all possible outcomes, including the 1s, which are neither prime nor composite. In the second approach, I'm considering only the cases where each die shows either prime or composite, effectively ignoring the 1s. So, which approach is correct?

The problem states that three dice show primes and the rest show composites. So, it's implied that all six dice must show either primes or composites, meaning no 1s are allowed. Therefore, the correct approach is to calculate the probability under the condition that each die shows either a prime or a composite, which means that the probability of each die showing a prime is 3/5, and composite is 2/5.

So, using the conditional probability approach, the probability is C(6,3) * (3/5)^3 * (2/5)^3 = 20 * (27/125) * (8/125) = 20 * 216 / 15625 = 4320 / 15625.

But wait, 4320 / 15625 can be simplified. Let's see:

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 4320 ÷5= 864, 15625 ÷5=3125.

So, 864/3125. Let's see if this reduces further. 864 and 3125 share any common factors? 864 is 2^5 * 3^3, and 3125 is 5^5. No common factors, so 864/3125 is the simplified fraction.

But looking at the options, none of them are 864/3125. Let me check the options again:

Options:
A: 5/55
B: 5/54
C: 125/7776
D: 3/18
E: 125/2916
F: 5/36
G: 5/16
H: 10/54
I: 1/6
J: 125/3888

Hmm, none of these match 864/3125. So, perhaps I made a mistake in this approach.

Wait, perhaps I should not have conditioned on the dice showing only primes or composites. Let's go back to the first approach where I included all possible outcomes, including 1s, but ensured that exactly three dice show primes and three show composites, with none showing 1s.

Wait, in the first approach, I calculated the number of favorable outcomes as C(6,3) * (3^3) * (2^3) = 20 * 27 * 8 = 4320. The total possible outcomes are 6^6 = 46656. So, the probability is 4320/46656, which simplifies to 5/54, as I found earlier.

Wait, but the problem is that in the first approach, I allowed for the possibility of 1s, but in the favorable outcomes, I'm requiring that exactly three are primes and three are composites, meaning that the other three cannot be 1s. So, perhaps that approach is correct.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says that three dice show primes and the rest show composites. So, the rest must be composites, which implies that all six dice must show either primes or composites. So, in other words, each die must show either a prime or a composite, but not 1.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways where exactly three dice show primes (2,3,5) and the other three show composites (4,6). Each die has 3 primes and 2 composites, so the number of favorable outcomes is C(6,3) * (3^3) * (2^3) = 20 * 27 * 8 = 4320.

The total number of possible outcomes where each die shows either a prime or a composite is 5^6, because each die has 5 possible outcomes (3 primes + 2 composites). So, 5^6 = 15625.

So, the probability is 4320 / 15625, which is what I calculated earlier. But none of the options match that. So, perhaps I'm getting confused between considering all possible outcomes (including 1s) and only the relevant ones.

Wait, let me clarify: the problem says that six dice are rolled, and we're to find the probability that exactly three show primes and the rest show composites. So, in this case, the rest showing composites implies that the other three cannot be primes or composites. Wait, no, composites are different from primes. So, the rest must show composites, meaning that all six dice must show either primes or composites. So, 1s are excluded.

Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for this scenario is 5^6, as each die has 5 possible outcomes (primes and composites). So, the total number of possible outcomes is 5^6 = 15625.

The number of favorable outcomes is C(6,3) * (3^3) * (2^3) = 20 * 27 * 8 = 4320.

So, the probability is 4320 / 15625 = 864/3125 ≈ 0.27648.

But looking at the options, none of them match this. The closest is option E: 125/2916 ≈ 0.0429, which is much lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try another way.

Each die has 6 sides: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Primes: 2,3,5 (3 numbers).

Composites: 4,6 (2 numbers).

Number 1: neither.

We need exactly three primes and three composites in six dice.

So, for each die, the probability of being prime is 3/6 = 1/2.

Probability of being composite is 2/6 = 1/3.

But since we're requiring that exactly three are primes and three are composites, and none are 1s, perhaps the total number of ways is C(6,3) * (3^3) * (2^3), as before, but the total possible outcomes where each die is either prime or composite is 5^6.

So, the probability is (C(6,3)*3^3*2^3) / 5^6 = (20 * 27 * 8) / 15625 = 4320 / 15625 = 864/3125.

But this isn't among the options. So, perhaps the problem is considering all possible outcomes, including those where some dice show 1s, but in our favorable outcomes, we're only considering the cases where exactly three are primes and three are composites, regardless of the 1s.

Wait, but that can't be because if some dice show 1s, then they are neither prime nor composite, so those cases wouldn't satisfy the condition of having exactly three primes and three composites. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider only the cases where exactly three are primes and three are composites, which means that the other three cannot be 1s. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^6, and the favorable is C(6,3)*(3^3)*(2^3).

So, the probability is 4320 / 46656 = 5/54, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the conditional probability where each die is either prime or composite, I got 864/3125, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the correct approach is the first one, where we include all possible outcomes but only count those where exactly three are primes and three are composites, regardless of the 1s.

Wait, but that approach would include cases where some dice show 1s, which would make the count of primes and composites less than six. So, that's incorrect because the problem states that three are primes and the rest are composites, meaning that all six must be either primes or composites.

Therefore, the correct approach is to model it as 6 dice, each showing either a prime or a composite, with the probabilities adjusted accordingly.

Wait, but then why isn't the answer matching any of the options? Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option E is 125/2916, which is approximately 0.0429. 5/54 is approximately 0.0926, which is option B. Option J is 125/3888, which is about 0.0321.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me try calculating 4320 / 46656 again.

4320 ÷ 46656.

Well, 4320 × 10 = 43200.

46656 - 43200 = 3456.

So, 4320 × 10.8 = 46656.

Therefore, 4320 / 46656 = 1 / 10.8 = 5/54.

So, that's correct. So, the probability is 5/54, which is option B.

Wait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought that the problem requires that all six dice show either primes or composites, meaning that 1s are excluded. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability as the number of favorable outcomes where exactly three are primes and three are composites, divided by the total number of possible outcomes where all six dice show either primes or composites.

In that case, the total number of possible outcomes is 5^6 = 15625.

Favorable outcomes: C(6,3) * (3^3) * (2^3) = 20 * 27 * 8 = 4320.

So, the probability is 4320 / 15625 = 864/3125 ≈ 0.27648.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the problem doesn't exclude 1s, meaning that the dice can show 1s, but the problem is about exactly three showing primes and the other three showing composites, regardless of whether some of them are 1s.

Wait, but that can't be because if some dice show 1s, then they aren't primes or composites, so it's impossible to have exactly three primes and three composites in that case. Therefore, the only way to have exactly three primes and three composites is that all six dice show either primes or composites, meaning that 1s are excluded.

So, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the probability as 5/54, which is option B, but that would be under the assumption that all dice show either primes or composites, which isn't the case because the total possible outcomes include 1s.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to clarify.

The problem says: Six 6-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that three of the dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers?

So, the rest (the other three) must show composite numbers. Therefore, all six dice must show either primes or composites. So, the 1s are not allowed in any of the dice because if any die shows 1, it's neither prime nor composite, which would violate the condition of having exactly three primes and three composites.

Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 5^6, as each die can only show primes or composites, which are 5 options (3 primes + 2 composites).

The number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose which three dice show primes and the other three show composites. So, C(6,3) * (3^3) * (2^3) = 20 * 27 * 8 = 4320.

So, the probability is 4320 / 5^6 = 4320 / 15625 = 864/3125.

But none of the options match this. Therefore, perhaps the problem isn't considering the exclusion of 1s, meaning that the dice can show 1s, but in the favorable cases, exactly three are primes, three are composites, and the rest (if any) are 1s.

Wait, but that can't be, because if any die shows a 1, it's neither, so the count of primes and composites would be less than six, which would violate the condition of exactly three primes and three composites.

Therefore, the only way to have exactly three primes and three composites is that all six dice show either primes or composites, meaning that the 1s are excluded. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 5^6, and the favorable is as calculated.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option J is 125/3888 ≈ 0.03215. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of favorable outcomes. Let me re-examine.

Each die has 3 primes and 2 composites, so for three primes and three composites, it's C(6,3) * (3^3) * (2^3). That's correct.

Wait, but 3^3 is 27, 2^3 is 8. 27 *8 = 216. 20 * 216 = 4320. So that's correct.

Now, 4320 / 46656 = 5/54, as I calculated earlier. So, 5/54 is option B.

But wait, another way to think about it is:

The probability that exactly three dice show primes and the other three show composites.

Each die has a 3/6 = 1/2 chance of being prime, and 2/6 = 1/3 chance of being composite.

But since the problem requires exactly three primes and three composites, we can model this using the binomial coefficients.

Wait, but the issue is that the probabilities of primes and composites aren't the same, so it's not a binomial distribution with p=1/2.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute it as:

Probability = C(6,3) * (3/6)^3 * (2/6)^3.

So, that would be 20 * (1/2)^3 * (1/3)^3 = 20 * (1/8) * (1/27) = 20 / 216 = 5 / 54.

Yes, that's the same as before. So, the probability is 5/54, which is option B.

Wait, but this approach doesn't account for the fact that the other three dice must show composites, which are only two options each. So, perhaps this approach is correct because it's considering the probabilities directly.

So, in this case, the probability is (6 choose 3) * (probability of three primes) * (probability of three composites) = 20 * (1/2)^3 * (1/3)^3 = 20 * (1/8) * (1/27) = 20 / 216 = 5 / 54.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is option B: 5/54.
</think>

The probability is calculated by determining the number of favorable outcomes where exactly three dice show prime numbers and the remaining three show composite numbers, divided by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six dice. Each die has three prime numbers (2, 3, 5) and two composite numbers (4, 6). The number of favorable outcomes is calculated using combinations and probabilities, leading to the result of 5/54.

Answer: B
