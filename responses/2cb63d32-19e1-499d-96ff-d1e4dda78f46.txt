Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"I marvel not a little, right worshipful, that since the first discovery of America (which is now full four score and ten years), after so great conquests and plantings of the Spaniards and Portuguese there, that we of England could never have the grace to set fast footing in such fertile and temperate places as are left as yet unpossessed of them. But . . . I conceive great hope that the time approacheth and now is that we of England may share and part stakes [divide the prize] (if we will ourselves) both with the Spaniard and the Portuguese in part of America and other regions as yet undiscovered.
"And surely if there were in us that desire to advance the honor of our country which ought to be in every good man, we would not all this while have [neglected] the possessing of these lands which of equity and right appertain unto us, as by the discourses that follow shall appear most plainly."
—Richard Hakluyt, Divers Voyages Touching the Discovery of America and the Islands Adjacent, 1582

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about a passage from Richard Hakluyt, and I need to figure out which of the given options best reflects the ideas in the passage. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the passage carefully. Hakluyt is talking about England's situation regarding America. He mentions that it's been about 80 years since the first discovery of America by the Spaniards and Portuguese, but England hasn't established a strong foothold there. He expresses surprise and, I think, some frustration that England hasn't acted sooner. He talks about the fertile and temperate lands that are still unpossessed, implying that England should take advantage of them.

He also mentions hope that the time is approaching for England to share and divide the prize with Spain and Portugal in America and other undiscovered regions. He argues that if there's a desire to advance the honor of the country, England shouldn't neglect possessing these lands that, by equity and right, belong to them.

So, the main ideas here are about England's potential to colonize and possess territories in America, the idea that it's their right or equity, and the desire for national honor and advancement. He's encouraging action to take these lands before others do, or perhaps to take what's rightfully theirs.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Renaissance cultural movement. The Renaissance was about art, science, and人文ism. Hakluyt's focus is more on colonialism and national gain, so maybe not directly Renaissance.

B: Enlightenment natural rights. Enlightenment ideas focus on individual rights, but Hakluyt is talking about national rights and colonial expansion, so maybe not exactly.

C: Social contract theory. That's more about the relationship between government and people, not really about colonial expansion.

D: Absolutism. This is about strong central authority, which doesn't seem to be the focus here.

E: Mercantilism. Mercantilism is an economic policy where the state controls trade for profit and national wealth. Hakluyt talks about advancing the honor of the country and possessing lands, which might align with mercantilist ideas about economic gain through colonization.

F: Capitalism. Capitalism is about private ownership and free markets, but the passage seems more about national expansion and government action, so maybe not.

G: Religious conversion. The passage doesn't mention spreading religion; it's more about territorial possession and national honor.

H: Predestination. Again, not relevant here.

I: Divine right of kings. This is about the king's authority being granted by God. Hakluyt isn't discussing the king's divine authority; he's more about national claims to land.

J: Colonialism. Colonialism refers to the policy and practice of acquiring control over other countries, generally with the intent to exploit them for economic gain. The passage is about England wanting to establish a presence in America, which fits with colonialism.

Wait, so both E (mercantilism) and J (colonialism) seem relevant. Let me think deeper. Mercantilism is about the economic policies of a state to increase wealth through trade and colonization. Hakluyt is advocating for England to take these lands for national gain, which aligns with mercantilist goals. However, colonialism is the broader concept of acquiring territories, which Hakluyt is definitely advocating for.

But the question is about the influence on the ideas expressed. So, the passage is pushing for England to engage in colonial activities, which is directly related to colonialism. Mercantilism is an economic policy that would drive such actions, but the passage is more about the justification for taking the land, the idea of equity and right, and national honor. It's not just about the economy but also about establishing a presence and asserting rights.

Alternatively, maybe it's both E and J, but since the options are single letters, I need to choose the best fit. The passage is more about the desire to possess lands and establish a colony, which is colonialism. Mercantilism is a policy that would follow, but the initial drive here is more about the act of colonization itself.

So, I think the answer is J: The philosophy of colonialism.
</think>

The passage expresses Hakluyt's advocacy for England to establish a colonial presence in America, emphasizing national honor and the right to possess lands. This aligns with the philosophy of colonialism, which focuses on acquiring territories for economic and strategic gain. While mercantilism is related, the passage's emphasis on territorial possession and national assertion fits colonialism better.

Answer: J
