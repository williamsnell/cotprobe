Okay, so I have this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The question is about a particular character in an animal species that is always transmitted from the mother to the offspring but never from the father. I need to figure out the mode of inheritance based on this information. The options are A through J.

Hmm, let me think about how traits are inherited. So, traits can be inherited through different mechanisms: autosomal, sex-linked, mitochondrial, etc. Also, there's something called genomic imprinting, where genes are expressed differently depending on whether they're inherited from the mother or the father.

The scenario here is that the trait is always passed down from the mother, but not from the father. So, if a father tries to pass it on, the offspring doesn't get it. That makes me think about which of these options fit.

Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: the trait is a result of genomic imprinting favoring maternal alleles. Genomic imprinting means that certain genes are only active when inherited from one parent. So if maternal alleles are favored, the offspring would only get the trait from the mother because the father's alleles might be imprinted and not expressed. That sounds plausible.

Option B: polygenic with maternal bias. Polygenic means it's influenced by multiple genes. But the question is about transmission, not the number of genes. Maternal bias could mean the mother passes it more often, but the question says it's always from the mother, never the father. So I'm not sure if this fits, as polygenic might involve both parents contributing, but maybe not necessarily. I'll keep this in mind.

Option C: Y-linked. Y-linked traits are passed from father to son because the Y chromosome comes from the father. But in this case, the trait isn't passed from the father, so Y-linked doesn't seem right. Unless it's recessive and the father doesn't have it, but the question says it's always from the mother, so probably not.

Option D: autosomal dominant. Autosomal means it's on a non-sex chromosome. Dominant traits show up if at least one copy is present. But if it's dominant, a father could pass it if he has it. The question says he never does, so this doesn't fit. Unless the father doesn't carry the dominant allele, but the question doesn't specify that.

Option E: sex-linked. This could be X-linked or Y-linked. If it's X-linked, females have two X's and males have one. If the mother has the trait, she could pass it to both sons and daughters. But the question says it's only from the mother. So maybe if it's X-linked recessive, but then males could carry it if their X comes from the mother. Wait, but the question says it's never transmitted from the father, so maybe the father can't pass it, which might be the case if it's X-linked recessive. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. If the trait is X-linked recessive, the mother could pass it to sons, but if the father doesn't have it, then he can't pass it. But the question says the trait is always from the mother, so maybe E could be possible, but I think A is more likely because genomic imprinting is more about whether the gene is expressed based on origin.

Option F: autosomal but influenced by maternal environmental factors. So the trait is on an autosome, but the mother's environment affects whether it's expressed. But the question is about transmission, not expression. So the mother could pass the gene, but if it's influenced by environment, maybe the father's transmission isn't possible? I'm not sure. This option seems more about gene expression rather than inheritance pattern.

Option G: extrachromosomal, only transmitted by mother. Extrachromosomal could refer to things like mitochondrial DNA or other non-chromosomal elements. Mitochondria are passed down from the mother, so if the trait is mitochondrial, then yes, only the mother can pass it. That's a possibility. But the question says "character in a certain species of animal," which could include mitochondrial traits.

Option H: paternal mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are usually from the mother, not the father. So if the trait is mitochondrial, the father can't pass it. But the question says the trait is transmitted from the mother, so if it's mitochondrial, that fits. But H says it's paternal, which would mean the father's mitochondria, which isn't typically the case. So H is probably incorrect.

Option I: autosomal recessive. For a recessive trait, you need two copies. If the mother passes it, the father might not. But if the father doesn't have it, then the children could only get it from the mother. But the question says the trait is always transmitted from the mother. Wait, if the trait is recessive, the mother must carry two copies. But the question doesn't specify whether the father can't pass it or just doesn't. So I'm not sure if I fits.

Option J: influenced by paternal epigenetic modifications. Epigenetics affects gene expression, but the question is about transmission, not expression. So if the father's epigenetic marks prevent the trait from showing, but the gene is present, that's different. The question says the trait is transmitted, so I'm not sure if J applies here.

Now, thinking again. The key point is that the trait is always from the mother, never from the father. So the father can't pass it on. Possible reasons: the gene is only on the X (but then males could pass it if they had it), or it's imprinted so that paternal alleles are inactive, or it's mitochondrial.

Wait, genomic imprinting (option A) is when the gene's expression depends on the parent of origin. So if the gene is only active when inherited from the mother, then the father's allele is not expressed, so the offspring wouldn't get it from the father. That fits the scenario.

Option G is about extrachromosomal, like mitochondrial. If the trait is mitochondrial, then yes, only the mother can pass it. So both A and G could be possibilities.

Wait, the question says "a particular character in a certain species of animal." Mitochondrial DNA is one possibility, but genomic imprinting is another. Let me see the options again.

Option A says genomic imprinting favoring maternal alleles. So if the maternal allele is imprinted and active, and the paternal is not, then the trait is only expressed when inherited from the mother. So the father's allele doesn't get passed on because it's not expressed, but actually, the gene is present, just not active. So the gene could be present in the father's gamete, but not expressed.

Option G says extrachromosomal, only transmitted by mother. So if it's mitochondrial, then yeah, only the mother can pass it. So the father's mitochondria aren't transmitted, so the trait can't come from him.

So both A and G are possibilities. But looking at the options, I need to pick the best fit.

Wait, the question says the trait is always transmitted from the mother. So if it's mitochondrial, the offspring always get it from the mother, because mitochondria are maternally inherited. But the question doesn't mention anything about the father's mitochondria. So in that case, G could be correct. But the question is about the mode of inheritance, which is usually about nuclear genes, but mitochondrial is a possibility.

Alternatively, genomic imprinting would affect nuclear genes, where the expression depends on the parent of origin.

So, which option is more likely? The question is about a "character," which could refer to a trait influenced by nuclear genes or mitochondrial. But in standard genetics, when we talk about transmission from parents, it's usually nuclear genes unless specified otherwise.

If the trait is always transmitted from the mother, but the father can't pass it, genomic imprinting (A) makes sense because the paternal allele is not expressed. So the trait doesn't show up when inherited from the father, but does when from the mother.

Another possibility is if the gene is on the X chromosome and is recessive. Let's say it's X-linked recessive. If the mother has the trait and the father doesn't, then sons would get it from her, but daughters would need two copies. Wait, but the question says it's always transmitted from the mother, which would mean that every offspring gets it from her, but the father never passes it. That might not fit X-linked because the father can't pass X-linked recessive to his sons (since he gives Y to sons), but daughters could get it from the mother. But the question says the trait is always transmitted from the mother, so maybe E (sex-linked) could be a possibility if it's X-linked and the father doesn't have the allele.

Wait, but the question says it's never transmitted from the father. So if it's X-linked, and the father doesn't have the allele, then he can't pass it. But the mother could pass it to both sons and daughters. So in that case, the trait would be X-linked recessive, and the father can't pass it because he doesn't have it. So the trait is always passed from the mother, never from the father. That would fit E (sex-linked).

But wait, in X-linked recessive, if the mother is a carrier (has one copy), she can pass it to sons, but not to daughters. But if the mother has two copies, then she can pass it to both sons and daughters. The question says the trait is always transmitted from the mother, which would mean every offspring gets it from her. That might require the mother to have two copies, which isn't always the case. But the question doesn't specify whether it's always present in the offspring or just always transmitted. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the trait is X-linked dominant, then the mother would pass it to all offspring, but the father could only pass it if he has it. But the question says the father never passes it, so maybe the father doesn't have the allele. So the trait is X-linked dominant, and the mother has it, so all her offspring get it. But the question doesn't specify whether the trait is dominant or recessive.

But the options don't specify dominance or recessivity for sex-linked. Option E just says sex-linked. So if the trait is X-linked, and the father doesn't have it, then the trait is always passed from the mother. That would fit option E. But I'm not sure if that's the intended answer.

But going back, the other possibility is genomic imprinting. So the trait is present only when inherited from the mother, because the paternal allele is imprinted and not expressed. So the father's allele is there but not active, meaning the offspring wouldn't show the trait if they got it from him, but they would if from the mother. So the trait is transmitted only maternally because the paternal allele doesn't work.

So which option is more correct? The question says the trait is always transmitted from the mother, but never from the father. So if it's genomic imprinting, the father's alleles are not expressed, but the gene is present. So the trait isn't passed on because it's not expressed, not because it's not transmitted. Wait, but the question says it's transmitted, so maybe genomic imprinting isn't about transmission but about expression.

Wait, no, genomic imprinting affects whether the gene is expressed, not whether it's transmitted. So if the gene is present in the paternal gamete, but imprinted (silenced), then the offspring would have the gene but not express the trait. But the question says the trait is transmitted, meaning the gene is passed on. So if the father can pass the gene but it's not expressed, then the trait wouldn't show up.

Wait, the question says the trait is transmitted from the mother but not the father. So the father's alleles don't result in the trait being passed on. So genomic imprinting could explain that because the father's alleles are not expressed, so the trait isn't transmitted via him. But the gene is still present in the offspring from the father, just not expressed.

Hmm, but the question says the trait is transmitted from the mother, which implies that the gene is passed on, and the father's alleles don't contribute to the trait. So if the gene is imprinted, the father's allele isn't expressed, so the trait doesn't manifest when inherited from him. But the gene is still transmitted, just not expressed. So the trait isn't "transmitted" in the sense that the offspring doesn't show it, but the gene is there.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: genomic imprinting favoring maternal alleles. So maternal alleles are expressed, paternal are not. So if the offspring gets the gene from the father, it's not expressed. So the trait is only seen when inherited from the mother. So the trait is transmitted from the mother, but not from the father because the father's version doesn't work.

So in that case, the trait is present in the offspring only if inherited from the mother. So the father can't pass on the trait because his allele is imprinted and not active. So the trait is always transmitted from the mother, but never from the father because the father's allele doesn't produce the trait.

Alternatively, if it's mitochondrial (option G), then the father's mitochondria aren't passed on, so the trait can't come from him. So the trait is only transmitted via the mother.

So which is more likely the intended answer? The question is about a "character" in a species, which could be either nuclear or mitochondrial. But genomic imprinting is a nuclear phenomenon, so option A would be about nuclear genes.

Wait, but the question says the trait is always transmitted from the mother. So if it's mitochondrial, the mother always passes it, but the father can't. So the trait is transmitted only maternally. So option G says it's extrachromosomal and only transmitted by the mother. That would fit.

But option A is about genomic imprinting. So which is more correct?

Alternatively, the question might be referring to nuclear genes. Let me think about the options again.

If the trait is mitochondrial, then it's extrachromosomal, and only the mother can pass it. So that's option G.

But the question includes options about genomic imprinting and mitochondrial. So which one is more appropriate.

Wait, the answer options are A through J. Let me recheck the options.

Looking back, option G says "an extrachromosomal trait could only be transmitted by the mother." So if the trait is extrachromosomal (like mitochondrial), then yes, only the mother can pass it. So that would fit the scenario.

But then, what about option A, which is about genomic imprinting. So if the trait is nuclear and imprinted, then the father's alleles are not expressed, so the trait doesn't appear when inherited from him. But the gene is passed on. Wait, the question says the trait is transmitted, not whether it's expressed. Hmm, perhaps I'm conflating transmission and expression.

Wait, the question says the trait is always transmitted from the mother to the offspring, but never from the father. So the mother passes the gene, the father doesn't. So in that case, if the gene is mitochondrial, then the father can't pass it, so only the mother can. So that fits.

If the gene is nuclear and imprinted, the father could pass the gene, but it's not expressed. So the trait isn't transmitted in the sense of being expressed, but the gene is there. But the question says the trait is transmitted, so perhaps it's more about the gene being passed on, not the expression.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between gene transmission and trait expression. The question is about the mode of inheritance, so it's about how the gene is passed on, not whether it's expressed.

So if the gene is mitochondrial, then it's always transmitted by the mother, which fits option G.

If the gene is nuclear and imprinted, the gene could be passed on by the father, but it's not expressed, so the trait doesn't show up. But the question says the trait is transmitted from the mother, which would mean the gene is passed on. So maybe the gene is present in the father's gamete but not expressed, but the mother's gamete does pass it and is expressed.

Wait, but the question says the trait is always transmitted from the mother. So perhaps the gene is only present in the mother's gamete. That would be the case if the gene is on the X chromosome and the father doesn't have it, but that's a sex-linked scenario.

Alternatively, if the gene is on the Y chromosome, but that's option C, which doesn't fit because Y-linked is passed from father to son, but the question says it's never transmitted from the father.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to summarize:

- The trait is always from the mother, never the father.

Possible explanations:

1. The gene is on the X chromosome and is recessive, and the father doesn't have it. So the mother passes it to all her offspring (sons and daughters if she has two copies). But the father can't pass it because he has Y. So the trait is X-linked recessive, and the father doesn't carry it. But the question doesn't specify whether the trait is recessive or dominant.

2. The gene is mitochondrial, so only the mother can pass it. That fits option G.

3. The gene is imprinted so that maternal alleles are expressed, paternal are not. So the father can pass the gene, but it's not expressed, so the trait doesn't show up. But the question says the trait is transmitted, so perhaps the gene is transmitted but not expressed when from the father. So the trait is always from the mother because the father's alleles don't contribute. So this fits option A.

I think the intended answer is option A, genomic imprinting. Because if the gene is imprinted, the father's allele is not expressed, so the offspring can't inherit the trait from him. But the mother's allele is active, so the trait is transmitted from her.

Alternatively, if it's mitochondrial, then it's transmitted only by the mother, which is option G. But I'm not sure if the question is considering mitochondrial traits as 'extrachromosomal' since they are passed through cytoplasm.

Wait, the options include option G: an extrachromosomal trait could only be transmitted by the mother. So that's correct for mitochondrial traits.

But the question is about a 'character,' which is a trait, and mitochondrial traits are possible.

So, which is more likely? I think genomic imprinting (A) or mitochondrial (G) are the main possibilities.

But let me think about the other options again. Option E is sex-linked. If the trait is X-linked and the father doesn't have it, then the mother can pass it to sons and daughters, but the father can't pass it. So that would fit the scenario. So why isn't E the answer?

Because the question says the trait is always transmitted from the mother. So if it's X-linked recessive, the mother must have two copies, but if she's a carrier (has one), then sons would get it, but daughters wouldn't unless they get two. So the trait isn't always transmitted to all offspring from the mother. Unless the mother has two copies, which isn't always the case. So the question says "always transmitted," which suggests that every offspring gets it from the mother, which would require the mother to have two copies, but the father has none. So in that case, the trait is X-linked recessive, and the mother is homozygous. But the question doesn't specify that, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if it's X-linked dominant, then the mother can pass it to all offspring, and the father can only pass it if he has it. But the question says the father never passes it, so he doesn't have it. So the trait is X-linked dominant, and the mother has it, so all her offspring get it. That would fit, making option E correct.

But the question is about the mode of inheritance, not whether it's dominant or recessive. So option E just says sex-linked, which could be either.

I'm getting a bit stuck between options A, E, and G.

Let me think about each option's description.

Option A: genomic imprinting favoring maternal alleles. So the maternal alleles are expressed, paternal are not. So the trait is only active when from the mother.

Option E: sex-linked. So if it's X-linked, and the father doesn't have the allele, then the mother can pass it to all her offspring.

Option G: extrachromosomal, only mother. So mitochondrial.

The question says the trait is always transmitted from the mother, but never from the father.

If it's genomic imprinting, the father can pass the gene, but it's not expressed. So the trait is transmitted (gene is present) but not expressed from the father. But the question says the trait is transmitted, so maybe the gene is present but not expressed, which doesn't fit the scenario of the question. The question says it's transmitted, which implies the trait shows up when from the mother, and not from the father, regardless of the gene's presence.

Alternatively, if the gene is only present in the mother, then the father can't pass it. That would be the case for mitochondrial genes (G) or if the gene is on the X and the father doesn't have it (E).

But the question doesn't specify whether the father has the allele but it's not expressed or doesn't have it at all.

So, considering all this, I think the best answer is A: genomic imprinting favoring maternal alleles. Because if the gene is imprinted, the father's allele isn't expressed, so the trait isn't transmitted from him. The mother's allele is active, so the trait is transmitted from her.

Wait, but genomic imprinting affects expression, not transmission. So the gene could be present from the father but not expressed. So the trait is transmitted (gene is present) but not expressed when from the father. But the question says the trait is transmitted, meaning the offspring has it when from the mother, but not when from the father. So I'm not sure if A is about transmission or expression.

Alternatively, if the gene is only present in the mother's gametes, then it's transmitted only by her. That could be mitochondrial (G) or if the father doesn't have the allele at all, like in a sex-linked scenario where the father can't pass it.

I think the intended answer is A, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, it could be E or G.

Wait, another approach: think about what each option implies.

Option A: Genomic imprinting. So the same allele is expressed differently based on the parent. So if the gene is passed from the father, it's not expressed. So the trait is only seen when inherited from the mother. So the gene is transmitted, but the trait only shows when from the mother. So the trait is transmitted from the mother, but the father's transmission doesn't result in the trait. So the trait is always transmitted from the mother, but not from the father because the father's alleles aren't expressed. So this fits the question.

Option G: Extrachromosomal. So the trait is transmitted via mitochondria, which are only from the mother. So the father can't pass it. So the trait is always transmitted from the mother, and the father can't pass it. So this also fits.

So both A and G fit, but the question is about a "character," which could be either nuclear or mitochondrial. But the options are separate, so I need to choose the best fit.

In most genetics questions, when they talk about transmission from mother and not father, it's often about sex-linked traits or genomic imprinting. Mitochondrial is a possibility but perhaps less likely unless specified.

Wait, the question says "a particular character," which could be any trait. So if it's mitochondrial, then G is correct. But if it's a nuclear gene with imprinting, then A is correct.

I think the intended answer is A: genomic imprinting. Because the question is about the mode of inheritance, and genomic imprinting affects whether the gene is expressed based on the parent. So the trait is only expressed when inherited maternally, making it always transmitted from the mother and not from the father.

But I'm still not entirely confident. Alternatively, the answer could be G, but I think A is more likely.
</think>

The question asks about the mode of inheritance for a trait that is always transmitted from the mother to the offspring but never from the father. To determine the correct answer, we analyze the options:

1. **Option A (Genomic imprinting favoring maternal alleles):** Genomic imprinting is a mechanism where genes are expressed based on their parental origin. If maternal alleles are favored, the trait would only be expressed when inherited from the mother, and paternal alleles would be silenced. This fits the scenario because the trait is transmitted from the mother but not from the father due to the inactivation of paternal alleles.

2. **Option E (Sex-linked):** A sex-linked trait could be X-linked. If the trait is X-linked recessive, the mother could pass it to her offspring, but the father, having a Y chromosome, cannot pass it. However, the question specifies that the trait is always transmitted from the mother, which would require the mother to have two copies of the allele, which is not universally guaranteed. Thus, while plausible, this option is less likely.

3. **Option G (Extrachromosomal trait transmitted only by the mother):** Mitochondrial traits are transmitted exclusively by the mother, as mitochondria are passed through the cytoplasm of the egg. This also fits the scenario, but the question does not explicitly mention mitochondrial inheritance, making this option less definitive.

4. **Other options:** Options B, C, D, F, H, I, and J do not align with the described inheritance pattern. For example, Y-linked traits are passed from the father, autosomal dominant or recessive traits would typically involve transmission from both parents, and polygenic or epigenetic influences do not directly explain the described transmission pattern.

Between the most plausible options, **A (genomic imprinting)** and **G (extrachromosomal trait)** both fit the scenario. However, genomic imprinting is a more likely explanation in the context of nuclear genes, which are typically the focus of inheritance questions unless otherwise specified. Therefore, the best answer is:

**Answer: A**
