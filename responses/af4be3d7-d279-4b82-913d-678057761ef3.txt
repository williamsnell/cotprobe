Question:

How many moles of propane (C3H8) are there in 6.2 g of propane?

Options:

C: 71 mol
D: 14.1 × 10^-1 mol
E: 1.4 × 10^-1 mol
F: 1.41 × 10^2 mol
G: 7.1 × 10^-1 mol
H: 0.71 mol
I: 1.4 mol
J: 141 mol

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many moles of propane are in 6.2 grams. Hmm, propane is C3H8, right? I remember that to find moles, I need to use the molar mass. 

First, I think I should calculate the molar mass of propane. The formula is C3H8, so that's 3 carbons and 8 hydrogens. Carbon has an atomic mass of about 12 g/mol, and hydrogen is about 1 g/mol. So for carbon, 3 times 12 is 36 g/mol. Hydrogen, 8 times 1 is 8 g/mol. Adding those together, 36 plus 8 equals 44 g/mol. So the molar mass of propane is 44 grams per mole.

Now, the problem gives me 6.2 grams of propane. To find the number of moles, I divide the mass by the molar mass. So that's 6.2 g divided by 44 g/mol. Let me do that calculation. 

6.2 divided by 44. Let's see, 44 goes into 6.2 how many times? Well, 44 times 0.1 is 4.4, and 44 times 0.14 is about 6.16. Oh wait, 0.14 times 44 is 6.16. So 6.2 divided by 44 is approximately 0.1409 moles. 

Looking at the options, option E is 1.4 × 10^-1 mol, which is the same as 0.14 mol. Option G is 7.1 × 10^-1, which is 0.71, that's too high. Option H is 0.71, also too big. Option I is 1.4, which is double what I got. Option E seems right. 

Wait, did I calculate correctly? Let me check again. 44 times 0.14 is 6.16, which is close to 6.2. So yes, 0.14 moles. So the correct answer should be E.

To determine the number of moles of propane (C₃H₈) in 6.2 g, we first calculate the molar mass of propane. Propane has 3 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms. The atomic mass of carbon is 12 g/mol, and hydrogen is 1 g/mol. Thus, the molar mass of propane is:

\[
3 \times 12 + 8 \times 1 = 36 + 8 = 44 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

Next, we use the formula for moles:

\[
\text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{6.2 \, \text{g}}{44 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.1409 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to 0.1409 mol is \(1.4 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{mol}\), which corresponds to option E.
