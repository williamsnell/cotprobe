Okay, so I've got this question about which tuna can is a better buy. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the question says there are two cans of the same brand. The first can is 7 and a half ounces and costs 57 cents. The second can is 8 and a quarter ounces and costs 64 cents. I need to find out which one gives you more tuna for your money, right? So, it's about calculating the unit price, I think. Unit price is like how much each ounce costs, so I can compare them.

Let me write down the details. 

First can: 7.5 ounces for 57 cents.
Second can: 8.25 ounces for 64 cents.

Hmm, to find the unit price, I need to divide the price by the number of ounces. 

Starting with the first can. So, 57 cents divided by 7.5 ounces. Let me calculate that. 

57 ÷ 7.5. Hmm, 7.5 goes into 57 how many times? Let's see, 7.5 times 7 is 52.5, because 7 times 7 is 49, and 0.5 times 7 is 3.5, so 49 + 3.5 = 52.5. Then 57 minus 52.5 is 4.5. So, 4.5 divided by 7.5 is 0.6, because 7.5 times 0.6 is 4.5. So total is 7 + 0.6 = 7.6 cents per ounce. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again.

Wait, maybe I should do it differently. 57 divided by 7.5. Alternatively, I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate the decimal. So 57*2=114, 7.5*2=15. So now it's 114 ÷ 15. Let's see, 15 times 7 is 105, so 114-105=9. Then 9/15 is 0.6. So total is 7.6 cents per ounce. Yeah, that's correct. So the first can is 7.6 cents per ounce.

Now the second can: 64 cents for 8.25 ounces. So 64 ÷ 8.25. Let me calculate that. 

I can also eliminate the decimal by multiplying numerator and denominator by 100 to make it 6400 ÷ 825. Hmm, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe I can divide 64 by 8.25 directly. 

Wait, 8.25 is the same as 8 and a quarter, which is 33/4. So dividing by 33/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/33. So 64 * (4/33) = (64*4)/33 = 256/33. Let me calculate that. 33 times 7 is 231, 33*7.75 is 256. Wait, 33*7=231, 33*0.75=24.75, so 231+24.75=255.75, which is close to 256. So 256/33 is approximately 7.7576. So about 7.76 cents per ounce. 

Wait, that can't be right because 8.25 ounces for 64 cents. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try another way. Let's see, 8.25 ounces is 8 and 1/4, which is 8.25. So 64 ÷ 8.25.

Let me think in terms of fractions. 8.25 is 33/4. So 64 divided by 33/4 is 64 * 4/33. 64 *4 is 256, so 256 divided by 33. Let me do that division again. 33 goes into 256 how many times? 33*7=231, subtract that from 256, we get 25. Bring down a zero: 250. 33 goes into 250 seven times again (7*33=231), subtract, get 19. Bring down another zero: 190. 33 goes into 190 five times (5*33=165), subtract, get 25. So it's repeating. So 256/33 is approximately 7.7575... So about 7.76 cents per ounce.

Wait, but that seems higher than the first can. But wait, the first can was 7.6 cents per ounce, and the second is about 7.76. So the first can is cheaper per ounce. So the first can is a better buy.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because that seems a bit counterintuitive. Maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check again.

First can: 7.5 ounces for 57 cents. 57 ÷ 7.5. Let me compute 57 ÷ 7.5. 7.5 times 7 is 52.5, as before. 57 -52.5=4.5. 4.5 ÷7.5=0.6. So total is 7.6 cents per ounce. Correct.

Second can: 64 ÷8.25. Let me calculate using decimals. 8.25 goes into 64 how many times? Let's see, 8.25 * 7 = 57.75. 64 -57.75=6.25. 8.25 goes into 6.25 about 0.757 times because 8.25 *0.75=6.1875, which is close to 6.25. So total is approximately 7.757, so 7.76 cents per ounce.

So the first can is cheaper per ounce. So the first can is a better buy. So the answer should be option B: The first can.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is "The second can." So I need to make sure. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, maybe I did something wrong. Let me try another approach. Maybe calculate the price per ounce for both and compare.

First can: 57 cents /7.5 oz = 7.6 cents/oz.

Second can: 64 cents/8.25 oz. Let me compute 64 ÷8.25. 

Alternatively, I can think of 8.25 as 8 + 0.25. So 8 ounces would cost (64 cents * (8/8.25)) but that's not helpful. Maybe better to compute 64 ÷8.25.

Wait, 8.25 * 7 = 57.75. 64 -57.75 =6.25. Now, 6.25 is what's left. So 6.25 ÷8.25 = 0.757 approximately. So total is 7.757, which is about 7.76. 

So the second can is about 7.76 cents per ounce, which is more than the first can's 7.6 cents. So the first can is cheaper per ounce. Therefore, the first can is a better buy, so option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is "The first can." So that's the correct answer.

To determine which can is a better buy, calculate the unit price (price per ounce) for both cans.

**First can:**  
- **Price:** 57 cents  
- **Ounces:** 7.5 oz  
- **Unit price:** 57 ÷ 7.5 = 7.6 cents per ounce  

**Second can:**  
- **Price:** 64 cents  
- **Ounces:** 8.25 oz  
- **Unit price:** 64 ÷ 8.25 ≈ 7.76 cents per ounce  

Since the first can has a lower unit price (7.6 cents per ounce) compared to the second can (≈7.76 cents per ounce), the first can is the better buy.

**Answer:** B
