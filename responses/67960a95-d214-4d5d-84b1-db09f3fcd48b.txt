Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the impedance of a circuit. The question says that when a voltage of 100∠0° volts is applied, the current is 7.07 + j7.07 amperes. I need to find the impedance from the given options. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that impedance in AC circuits is similar to resistance in DC circuits, but it includes both resistance and reactance. Impedance is calculated using Ohm's Law, which is Z = V / I, where Z is impedance, V is voltage, and I is current. Oh wait, but since we're dealing with complex numbers here because of the j component, I need to handle that correctly.

So the voltage is given as 100∠0° V. That means it's a purely real number with no imaginary part. In rectangular form, that's 100 + j0 volts. The current is 7.07 + j7.07 A. Both the real and imaginary parts are positive, so the current has both magnitude and a 45° angle because the real and imaginary parts are equal. Oh right, because when the real and imaginary parts are equal, the angle is 45 degrees. So the current can be written as 7.07√2∠45° A, but maybe I don't need that right now.

Wait, let me get back. I need to compute Z = V / I. Since both V and I are complex numbers, I'll have to perform a division of complex numbers. Alternatively, maybe I can represent them in polar form and then divide, which might be easier.

Let me try converting both to polar form. The voltage is already given as 100∠0°, which is straightforward. The current is 7.07 + j7.07. Let me find its magnitude and angle. The magnitude is the square root of (7.07² + 7.07²). Let's compute that: 7.07 squared is approximately 50, so 50 +50 is 100. The square root of 100 is 10. So the magnitude is 10 A. The angle is arctangent of (7.07/7.07) which is arctan(1) = 45°. So the current in polar form is 10∠45° A.

Now, the voltage is 100∠0°, and the current is 10∠45°. So impedance Z = V / I. In polar form, that's (100∠0°) / (10∠45°) = (100/10) * ∠(0° - 45°) = 10∠-45°. 

Wait, wait. So 100 divided by 10 is 10, and the angles subtract because when you divide in polar form, you subtract the angles. So 0° minus 45° is -45°. So Z is 10∠-45°. Now, converting that back to rectangular form. The formula is Z = |Z| * (cosθ + j sinθ). So |Z| is 10, θ is -45°. Cos(-45°) is the same as cos(45°), which is √2/2 ≈0.7071. Sin(-45°) is -√2/2 ≈-0.7071.

So Z = 10*(0.7071 - j0.7071) = 7.071 - j7.071 Ω. Looking at the options, option H is 7.07 - j7.07 Ω. That looks right. But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes signs can be tricky.

Wait, the current is 7.07 + j7.07, which I converted to polar as 10∠45°. So when I divide V by I, which is 100∠0° divided by 10∠45°, that's correct. So 100 /10 is 10, and the angle is 0 -45 = -45. So Z is 10∠-45°, which is approximately 7.07 - j7.07. That's option H.

Alternatively, maybe I should try it without converting to polar form, just using rectangular division. Let me try that approach to confirm.

In rectangular form, Z = V/I. V is 100 + j0. I is 7.07 + j7.07. So Z = (100 + j0) / (7.07 + j7.07).

To divide complex numbers, I can multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of (7.07 + j7.07) is (7.07 - j7.07).

So Z = [ (100 + j0)(7.07 - j7.07) ] / [ (7.07 + j7.07)(7.07 - j7.07) ]

Let me compute the denominator first: (7.07)^2 + (7.07)^2 because (a + jb)(a - jb) = a² + b². 7.07 squared is about 50, so 50 +50 = 100. So denominator is 100.

Now the numerator: (100)(7.07) + (100)(-j7.07) + (0)(7.07) + (0)(-j7.07). Wait, that's 100*7.07 = 707, and 100*(-j7.07) = -j707, and the other terms are zero. So numerator is 707 - j707.

So Z = (707 - j707) / 100 = 7.07 - j7.07 Ω. Yep, that's the same as before. So option H is correct.

The impedance is calculated using Ohm's Law, \( Z = \frac{V}{I} \). The voltage is \( 100 \angle 0^\circ \, \text{V} \) and the current is \( 7.07 + j7.07 \, \text{A} \). Converting the current to polar form gives \( 10 \angle 45^\circ \, \text{A} \). Dividing the voltage and current in polar form yields \( Z = 10 \angle -45^\circ \, \Omega \), which converts back to rectangular form as \( 7.07 - j7.07 \, \Omega \). This matches option H.

Answer: H
