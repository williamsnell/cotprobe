Okay, so Mary O'Grady has to calculate her gross earnings for the week, and I need to figure this out step by step. Let's break it down.

First, her regular pay is $3.10 per hour. She worked 44 hours during the regular week (Monday-Friday). But wait, the regular week is supposed to be 40 hours, right? So anything over 40 in the regular week is time and a half. So she worked 44 hours, which is 4 hours over. So those 4 hours will be paid at 1.5 times her regular rate.

Then, she worked on Saturday: 4 and a half hours. The problem says time and a half is paid for all Saturday work. So that 4.5 hours will also be at 1.5 times her regular rate.

On Sunday, she worked 3 hours, and that's double time, so 2 times her regular rate.

Let me calculate each part separately.

First, regular hours: 40 hours at $3.10. So 40 * 3.10 = $124.00.

Then, the overtime in the regular week: 4 hours. So 4 * (3.10 * 1.5). Let's compute that. 3.10 * 1.5 is 4.65. So 4 * 4.65 = $18.60.

Next, Saturday work: 4.5 hours at 1.5 times. So 4.5 * 4.65. Let me calculate that: 4 * 4.65 is 18.60, and 0.5 *4.65 is 2.325. So total is 18.60 + 2.325 = $20.925, which is $20.93.

Then, Sunday work: 3 hours at double time. 3 * (3.10 * 2). 3.10 *2 is 6.20. So 3 *6.20 = $18.60.

Now, add all these parts together.

Regular: 124.00
Overtime regular: 18.60
Saturday: 20.93
Sunday: 18.60

Total = 124 + 18.60 = 142.60
142.60 + 20.93 = 163.53
163.53 + 18.60 = 182.13

Wait, that adds up to $182.13. Looking at the options, option D is $182.13. So the answer should be D.

Mary's gross earnings are calculated by adding her regular pay, overtime, Saturday pay, and Sunday pay. Each component is computed based on the given rates and hours worked. The total sums to $182.13.

Answer: D
