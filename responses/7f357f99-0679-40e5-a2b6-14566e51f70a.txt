Question:

Suppose the marginal utility to David Jones of product A is defined by the function, MU_A = 10 - x, where x is the number of units of A pro-duced. For B, MU_B = 21 - 2y, where y is the number of units of B produced. Assume that the price of A = price of B = $1. How much of A and B would David buy if he had $7 to spend?

Options:

A: Two units of product A and four units of product B
B: one unit of product A and six units of product B
C: two units of product A and five units of product B
D: Three units of product A and three units of product B
E: Zero units of product A and seven units of product B
F: Five units of product A and two units of product B
G: three units of product A and four units of product B
H: Six units of product A and one unit of product B
I: four units of product A and three units of product B
J: Seven units of product A and zero units of product B

Okay, so I have to figure out how much of product A and B David Jones would buy with $7, given their marginal utility functions and the prices. Let's see. The marginal utilities are MU_A = 10 - x and MU_B = 21 - 2y, where x is the number of units of A and y is the units of B. Both prices are $1 each.

Hmm, I remember that the consumer equilibrium condition says that the marginal utilities per dollar should be equal across all goods. So, MU_A / Price_A = MU_B / Price_B. Since both prices are 1, it simplifies to MU_A = MU_B.

So, I need to find x and y such that 10 - x = 21 - 2y, and the total expenditure is 7: x + y = 7.

Let me write down the equations:

1. 10 - x = 21 - 2y
2. x + y = 7

I can rearrange the first equation. Let's subtract 10 from both sides: -x = 11 - 2y. So, x = 2y - 11.

Wait, that seems a bit odd because if y is a non-negative integer, 2y -11 could be negative, which isn't possible since x can't be negative. Maybe I should do it differently.

Let me rearrange equation 1:

10 - x = 21 - 2y
=> 2y - x = 21 - 10
=> 2y - x = 11

Now, from equation 2: x = 7 - y.

Substitute x into equation 1:

2y - (7 - y) = 11
2y -7 + y =11
3y -7 =11
3y=18
y=6

So y is 6. Then x=7-6=1.

Wait, so x=1 and y=6. Let me check if this satisfies the MU equality.

MU_A when x=1: 10-1=9.
MU_B when y=6:21-2*6=21-12=9. Yes, equal. So that's correct.

But looking at the options, option B is 1 unit of A and 6 units of B. So that should be the answer.

Wait, let me make sure. Let me walk through the process again.

Total money is $7, so x + y =7.

Set MU_A = MU_B: 10 -x =21 -2y.

So, 10 -x =21 -2y → Rearranged: 2y -x =11.

Substitute x=7-y into 2y - (7 - y) = 11 → 2y -7 + y =11 → 3y=18 → y=6, x=1.

Yes, that seems right. So the answer is option B.
</think>

The consumer equilibrium condition requires that the marginal utilities per dollar be equal. Given that both prices are $1, this simplifies to setting the marginal utilities equal: MU_A = MU_B. Solving the equations 10 - x = 21 - 2y and x + y = 7 yields x = 1 and y = 6. Therefore, David would buy 1 unit of A and 6 units of B.

Answer: B
