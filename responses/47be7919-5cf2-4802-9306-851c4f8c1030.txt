Question:

An ideal gas is contained within a volume of 2ft^3, when the pressure is 137 atmosphere and the temperature is 27° C. What volume would be occupied by this gas if it were allowed to expand to atmospheric pressure at a temperature of 50° C?

Options:

A: 150ft^3
B: 450ft^3
C: 295ft^3
D: 325ft^3
E: 350ft^3
F: 400ft^3
G: 500ft^3
H: 200ft^3
I: 275ft^3
J: 250ft^3

Okay, so I've got this problem about an ideal gas expanding, and I need to find the new volume after it expands. Let me see... I remember that ideal gases follow the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. But wait, since the amount of gas isn't changing, maybe I can use the combined gas law, which relates the initial and final states.

The problem says the initial volume is 2 ft³, pressure is 137 atmospheres, and temperature is 27°C. Then it expands to atmospheric pressure (so 1 atm) at 50°C. I need to find the new volume.

First, I should convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin because the gas laws use absolute temperatures. To do that, I add 273.15 to each temperature. So, 27°C is 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 K. And 50°C is 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 K.

Now, using the combined gas law: (P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2. I can rearrange this to solve for V2, which is V2 = (P1 * V1 * T2) / (P2 * T1).

Plugging in the numbers: P1 is 137 atm, V1 is 2 ft³, T1 is 300.15 K, P2 is 1 atm, and T2 is 323.15 K.

So V2 = (137 atm * 2 ft³ * 323.15 K) / (1 atm * 300.15 K). 

Let me calculate that step by step. First, multiply 137 and 2: that's 274. Then multiply by 323.15. Hmm, 274 * 323.15. Let me approximate that. 274 * 300 is 82,200. 274 * 23.15 is about 274*20=5,480 and 274*3.15≈862.1. So total is roughly 82,200 + 5,480 + 862.1 = 88,542.1.

Then the denominator is 1 * 300.15 ≈ 300.15.

So V2 ≈ 88,542.1 / 300.15 ≈ let's see, 88,542 divided by 300 is approximately 295.14 ft³.

Looking at the options, option C is 295 ft³. That seems right. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the multiplication or division.
