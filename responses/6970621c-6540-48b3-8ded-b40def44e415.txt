Okay, so I've got this question about liquid nitrogen and pressure. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I know.

The question says that liquid nitrogen is used as a bath at around 77 K, which is its normal boiling point. Now, the task is to find the pressure needed if we want to set the bath temperature higher, at 85 K. They also give the heat of vaporization as 5560 J/mol.

Hmm, I remember that the boiling point of a liquid depends on the pressure. At higher pressure, the boiling point increases, and at lower pressure, it decreases. Wait, but in this case, we're increasing the temperature above the normal boiling point. Does that mean we need a higher pressure than atmospheric? Or maybe lower? Wait, no, because if you raise the temperature while keeping it as a liquid, you might need to increase the pressure to prevent it from boiling.

Wait, wait, no. Normally, the boiling point is where the vapor pressure equals the external pressure. At 77 K, liquid nitrogen boils at 1 atm. If I want to keep it as a liquid at a higher temperature (85 K), I think I need to apply more pressure so that the vapor pressure at 85 K is higher than 1 atm. That way, the liquid can stay in equilibrium at that higher temperature.

So, the key here is to calculate the vapor pressure of nitrogen at 85 K and then determine the pressure needed to keep it from boiling. I think the formula for vapor pressure relates to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which connects the change in pressure with temperature for phase changes.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is typically written as:

ln(P2/P1) = -ΔH_vap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Where:
- P1 is the initial pressure (at 77 K, which is 1 atm)
- P2 is the desired pressure at T2 (85 K)
- ΔH_vap is the heat of vaporization (5560 J/mol)
- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)
- T1 is the initial temperature (77 K)
- T2 is the final temperature (85 K)

Wait, but wait a second. Since we're increasing the temperature, I'm not sure if the equation applies directly because the usual form is for when you're moving along the phase boundary. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the ideal gas law for the vapor. Alternatively, perhaps using the Antoine equation or some other vapor pressure model, but I don't think those are provided here. So, perhaps the Clausius-Clapeyron approach is the way to go.

Let me plug in the numbers. Let's see:

ΔH_vap is given as 5560 J/mol. R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

T1 is 77 K, P1 is 1 atm.

T2 is 85 K, P2 is what we're solving for.

So,

ln(P2/1 atm) = (-5560) / (8.314) * (1/85 - 1/77)

Wait, but wait, the formula is (1/T2 - 1/T1), right? Wait, no. Let me double-check the equation. The correct form is:

ln(P2/P1) = -ΔH_vap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1) / (1)

Wait, no, wait. The correct Clausius-Clapeyron equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1)

Because when temperature increases, if the substance is a liquid, the vapor pressure increases, so P2 > P1, so ln(P2/P1) is positive, which would require the right-hand side to be positive. So, the equation should be:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Wait, yes, that makes sense. Because when T2 > T1, 1/T1 > 1/T2, so (1/T1 - 1/T2) is positive, and if ΔH_vap is positive, then the right-hand side is positive, so ln(P2/P1) is positive, meaning P2 > P1. Which is what we expect because we're increasing temperature, so the vapor pressure increases, so to have the same phase (liquid), the external pressure must be higher than the vapor pressure at that higher temperature.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, when you have a liquid at a higher temperature, the vapor pressure increases. So, to keep the liquid from boiling (i.e., to keep it as a liquid), the external pressure must be higher than the vapor pressure at that higher temperature. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the question is about setting the bath temperature at 85 K. So, perhaps the pressure needed is the vapor pressure at 85 K.

Wait, no. Because normally, at 77 K, the vapor pressure is 1 atm. If we increase the temperature to 85 K, the vapor pressure would increase. So, if you want to keep the liquid nitrogen at 85 K without boiling, you need to have the external pressure higher than the vapor pressure at that temperature. But wait, that's not right because the boiling point is when the external pressure equals the vapor pressure. So, if you have a pressure higher than the vapor pressure at 85 K, the liquid would not boil, but it would stay as a liquid. But in this case, the question is about setting the bath temperature at 85 K, which suggests that the system is in equilibrium between liquid and vapor—so the pressure should equal the vapor pressure at 85 K.

Wait, but the question says "what pressure would you need to maintain over the liquid nitrogen" to set the bath temperature at 85 K. So, perhaps the pressure is the vapor pressure at that temperature. Because in a closed system, the pressure would adjust to match the vapor pressure at that temperature. But wait, in this case, it's a bath, so perhaps you're adding pressure to it.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed with the calculation.

So, using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔH_vap = 5560 J/mol
R = 8.314 J/mol·K
T1 = 77 K
T2 = 85 K

So,

ln(P2/1 atm) = (5560 / 8.314) * (1/77 - 1/85)

First, calculate (1/77 - 1/85):

1/77 ≈ 0.012987
1/85 ≈ 0.011765
Difference ≈ 0.001222

So,

5560 / 8.314 ≈ 668.59

Multiply by 0.001222:

668.59 * 0.001222 ≈ 0.816

So,

ln(P2/1 atm) ≈ 0.816

Now, exponentiating both sides:

P2/1 atm = e^(0.816) ≈ 2.26

So P2 ≈ 2.26 atm.

Wait, that would make sense because if you increase the temperature, the vapor pressure increases, so the required pressure is higher than 1 atm. Looking at the options, option B is 2.26 atm, which matches this calculation.

To determine the pressure needed to maintain liquid nitrogen at 85 K, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

Given:
- \( \Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 5560 \, \text{J/mol} \)
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \)
- \( T_1 = 77 \, \text{K} \) (normal boiling point, \( P_1 = 1 \, \text{atm} \))
- \( T_2 = 85 \, \text{K} \)

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \):

\[
\frac{1}{77} \approx 0.012987, \quad \frac{1}{85} \approx 0.011765
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \approx 0.001222
\]

Next, calculate \( \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \):

\[
\frac{5560}{8.314} \approx 668.59
\]

Now, multiply:

\[
668.59 \times 0.001222 \approx 0.816
\]

Taking the exponential:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{1 \, \text{atm}}\right) = 0.816 \implies \frac{P_2}{1 \, \text{atm}} = e^{0.816} \approx 2.26
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \approx 2.26 \, \text{atm} \).

The correct answer is **B: 2.26 atm**.
