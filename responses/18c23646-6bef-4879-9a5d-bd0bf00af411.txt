Okay, so I've got this question about psychology, specifically about reinforcement and punishment. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about a time-out situation where a disruptive child is removed from the classroom because they want to stay with their class. I need to figure out which concept this exemplifies from the given options.

First, I remember that reinforcement and punishment are key concepts in operant conditioning, which is B.F. Skinner's theory. Reinforcement refers to something that increases the likelihood of a behavior being repeated, while punishment decreases the likelihood. There are positive and negative versions of both.

Positive reinforcement involves adding something pleasant to increase a behavior. For example, giving a child a sticker when they behave well. Negative reinforcement, on the other hand, involves removing an unpleasant stimulus to increase behavior. Like taking away homework if the child cleans their room—so the child learns to clean to avoid homework.

Punishment is about decreasing a behavior. Positive punishment adds an unpleasant stimulus, like spanking a child for misbehaving. Negative punishment removes a pleasant stimulus, like taking away recess if the child doesn't finish their work. So negative punishment is about removing something good to stop the behavior.

In the question, the child is removed from the classroom. The child wants to stay, so being taken out is something they don't like. This is causing the child to stop the disruptive behavior. So the teacher is removing the child from the class, which is a form of negative punishment because it's taking away a desired situation to decrease the disruptive behavior.

Looking at the options:

A: Negative reinforcement—this would be removing something bad to increase behavior. Not the case here because the child is removed because of bad behavior.

B: Extrinsic reinforcement—this refers to rewards given by others, not necessarily punishment.

C: Intrinsic reinforcement—this is internal satisfaction, not related to external actions.

D: Operant conditioning—this is a broader term, but the question is asking for a specific concept.

E: Positive punishment—this adds something bad, like spanking, not removing something.

F: Observational learning—this is about learning by watching others, not about reinforcement.

G: Omission training—this isn't a standard term I'm familiar with.

H: Positive reinforcement—this adds something good, not removing.

I: Classical conditioning—this is about associations, like Pavlov's dogs, not operant behavior.

J: Negative punishment—this fits because it's removing something pleasant (staying with the class) to reduce the behavior.

So the correct answer should be J: negative punishment.

The situation described involves removing a child from the classroom to stop disruptive behavior. This is an example of negative punishment because it removes a desirable stimulus (staying with the class) to decrease the unwanted behavior. 

Answer: J
