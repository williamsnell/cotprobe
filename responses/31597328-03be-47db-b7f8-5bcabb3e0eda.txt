Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron in a rectangular well. Hmm, I remember that a rectangular well, or an infinite potential well, is a standard problem in quantum mechanics. The question is asking about the width of the well given some energy levels.

Let me read the problem again. The well has a depth of 20.0 eV, and the lowest energy level lies 3.00 eV above the bottom. So the bottom of the well is at some potential, and the top is 20 eV higher. The electron's energy is 3 eV above the bottom, which means it's 17 eV below the top of the well because 20 - 3 =17. Wait, no, actually, the depth is 20 eV, so the potential inside the well is zero, and outside is 20 eV. The lowest energy level is 3 eV above zero, so it's 3 eV. That makes sense.

I remember the formula for the energy levels in a 1D infinite potential well. The energy levels are given by:

E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m a²)

where:
- E_n is the energy of level n,
- h is Planck's constant,
- m is the mass of the electron,
- a is the width of the well,
- n is the quantum number (n=1,2,3...).

In this case, the lowest energy level is n=1, so E_1 = 3 eV.

So rearranging the formula to solve for a:

a = sqrt( (h²) / (8 m E_1) )

I think I can plug in the numbers here. Let me recall the values:

h is Planck's constant. I remember h = 4.135667696 × 10^-15 eV·s, but wait, in terms of J·s, h is 6.62607015 × 10^-34 J·s. Alternatively, maybe I should use the reduced Planck constant, ħ, but perhaps it's easier to work in eV and nm units.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula in terms of eV and nanometers. Let me see if I can find a version of the energy formula that uses those units.

Alternatively, maybe I should convert everything into SI units.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

First, E_1 = 3 eV. Let's convert that to joules because m (mass of electron) is in kg, and h is in J·s.

1 eV = 1.602176634 × 10^-19 J. So E_1 = 3 eV = 3 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 4.8065e-19 J.

Mass of electron, m = 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg.

h = 6.62607015 × 10^-34 J·s.

Plugging into the formula:

a = sqrt( (h²) / (8 m E_1) )

So let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Compute h²: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ (6.626)^2 = approx 43.9, so 43.9e-68 (since (1e-34)^2 =1e-68). Wait, 6.626e-34 squared is (6.626)^2 = ~43.9, so 43.9e-68 (because (1e-34)^2 =1e-68). So h² ≈ 43.9e-68 J²·s².

Denominator: 8 * m * E_1.

m = 9.109e-31 kg.

E_1 = 4.8065e-19 J.

So 8 * m * E_1 = 8 * 9.109e-31 kg * 4.8065e-19 J.

Let me compute that:

8 *9.109e-31 = 72.872e-31 = 7.2872e-30.

Multiply by 4.8065e-19:

7.2872e-30 *4.8065e-19 = let's compute 7.2872 *4.8065 ≈ 35.0, and exponents: 10^(-30-19)=10^-49.

So denominator is ~35.0e-49 = 3.5e-48.

So a² = (43.9e-68) / (3.5e-48) = (43.9 /3.5) * 10^(-68 +48) )= ~12.54 * 10^-20.

Wait, 43.9 / 3.5 is approximately 12.54.

So a² ≈ 12.54e-20 m².

Take square root: a = sqrt(12.54e-20) m.

sqrt(12.54) is about 3.54, and sqrt(1e-20) is 1e-10, so a ≈3.54e-10 m = 0.354 nm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 0.350 nm, option H is 0.264 nm, etc.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a calculation mistake? Because 3.54e-10 m is 0.354 nm, which is close to option G (0.350 nm). But wait, perhaps I should check my calculations again because that's an option. Alternatively, maybe I messed up a step.

Wait, let's go through the calculations more carefully.

Compute h²: (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 = approximately 43.9, so 43.9e-68 (since (1e-34)^2 is 1e-68). So h² =43.9e-68 J²s².

Denominator: 8 * m * E_1.

m=9.109e-31 kg, E_1=4.8065e-19 J.

8 *9.109e-31 = 72.872e-31 =7.2872e-30 kg.

7.2872e-30 kg * 4.8065e-19 J = let's compute 7.2872 *4.8065.

7 *4.8=33.6; 0.2872*4.8≈1.378; 7*0.0065=0.0455; 0.2872*0.0065≈0.001866. Hmm, perhaps a better way is to multiply 7.2872 *4.8065.

Let me calculate 7.2872 *4.8065.

7 * 4.8 = 33.6.

0.2872 *4.8 = approx 1.37856.

7 *0.0065=0.0455.

0.2872 *0.0065≈0.001866.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to just compute 7.2872 * 4.8065 using calculator-like steps.

7 *4 =28.

7 *0.8065=5.6455.

0.2872 *4=1.1488.

0.2872 *0.8065≈0.2314.

Adding them up:

28 +5.6455=33.6455.

33.6455 +1.1488=34.7943.

34.7943 +0.2314≈35.0257.

So 7.2872 *4.8065≈35.0257.

So the product is 35.0257e-49 (because 1e-30 *1e-19=1e-49).

So denominator is 35.0257e-49.

So a² = (43.9e-68) / (35.0257e-49) = (43.9 /35.0257) *1e^(-68+49) )= (approx 1.253) * 1e-19.

Wait, 43.9 ÷35.0257 is about 1.253.

So a² =1.253e-19 m².

Taking square root: a= sqrt(1.253e-19) = sqrt(1.253) * sqrt(1e-19).

sqrt(1.253)≈1.12, and sqrt(1e-19)=1e-9.5= approx 3.16e-10 m (since 1e-10 is 0.1 nm, 1e-9 is 1 nm, so 1e-9.5 is about 3.16e-10 m, which is 0.316 nm.

Wait, that's different from the earlier calculation. Did I make a mistake in exponents?

Wait, let me recheck the exponents.

h² is 43.9e-68.

Denominator is 35.0257e-49.

So 43.9e-68 /35.0257e-49 = (43.9 /35.0257) * 1e^(-68 +49) )= (approx 1.253) *1e^-19.

So a² =1.253e-19 m².

So sqrt(1.253e-19) = sqrt(1.253) * sqrt(1e-19).

sqrt(1.253) is approx 1.12.

sqrt(1e-19) is 1e-9.5, which is 3.16e-10 m, as 1e-10 is 0.1 nm, so 3.16e-10 is 0.316 nm.

Wait, so a≈1.12 *3.16e-10 m ≈3.54e-10 m = 0.354 nm.

Hmm, that's about 0.354 nm, which is close to option G (0.350 nm).

But wait, the problem gives the well depth as 20 eV, but the electron's energy is 3 eV above the bottom, which is 17 eV below the top. Wait, but in an infinite potential well, the particle is bound, so the energy is below the potential barrier. But wait, in this case, the depth is 20 eV, so the energy levels are from 0 to 20 eV. The lowest energy level is 3 eV above the bottom, which is correct.

Wait, but why did I get 0.354 nm earlier, but when I did the calculation again, I got a≈0.354 nm, but in another step I thought I got 0.316 nm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let me re-express the calculation more accurately.

Compute a² = h² / (8 m E_1 )

h² = (6.62607015e-34 J·s)^2 = (6.62607015)^2 * (1e-34)^2 = approx 43.9008 * 1e-68 =4.39008e-67 J²·s².

Denominator: 8 * m * E_1 =8 *9.10938356e-31 kg *4.8065e-19 J.

Compute 8 *9.10938356e-31 =72.8750685e-31 kg =7.28750685e-30 kg.

Multiply by E_1=4.8065e-19 J: 7.28750685e-30 kg *4.8065e-19 J = (7.2875 *4.8065) e^(-30-19) )= (approx 35.025) e-49 kg·J.

But J is kg·m²/s², so kg·J is kg²·m²/s², but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

So denominator D =35.025e-49 kg·J.

So a² = (4.39008e-67 J²·s²) / (35.025e-49 kg·J) )

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so J² is kg²·m^4/s^4.

So numerator: J²·s² → kg²·m^4/s^4 * s^2 = kg²·m^4/s^2.

Denominator: kg·J → kg * (kg·m²/s²) )= kg²·m²/s².

So when you divide numerator by denominator, you get (kg²·m^4/s^2 ) / (kg²·m²/s²) )= m².

So a² = (4.39008e-67 /35.025e-49 ) m².

Compute 4.39008e-67 /35.025e-49 = (4.39008 /35.025) * 1e^(-67 +49) )= (approx 0.1253) * 1e-18 = 1.253e-19 m².

So a²=1.253e-19 m² → a = sqrt(1.253e-19) = sqrt(1.253) * sqrt(1e-19) = approx 1.12 * 1e-9.5 m.

Because sqrt(1e-19) = 1e-9.5 = 3.1623e-10 m.

So a=1.12 *3.1623e-10 ≈3.54e-10 m =0.354 nm.

So the width is approximately 0.354 nm, which is very close to option G:0.350 nm.

But wait, looking at the options, option H is 0.264 nm. Hmm, that's quite a bit smaller. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula for the energy levels in a finite well is different, but the problem states it's a rectangular well, which I think refers to the infinite potential well, where the solution is sinusoidal inside the well. But wait, the hint says to use tanθ = sinθ / cosθ, which makes me think that perhaps this is a finite well problem because for infinite wells, the solution is purely sine or cosine, but for finite wells, you often get transcendental equations involving tanθ.

Wait, the problem says "rectangular well with a depth of 20.0 eV". Wait, in an infinite potential well, the depth would be infinite, but here it's finite at 20 eV. So perhaps this is a finite rectangular well, not an infinite one. That changes things.

In an infinite well, the energy levels are quantized as E_n = (n² h²)/(8 m a²). But in a finite well, the situation is more complex because the particle can have some probability of being outside the well, and the energy levels are determined by solving a transcendental equation involving sine and cosine terms, leading to a condition where the wave number k is related to the depth of the well.

Wait, but the problem gives the lowest energy level as 3 eV above the bottom, so the potential inside the well is zero, and the potential outside is 20 eV. So the electron's energy is E =3 eV, which is less than the depth, so it's a bound state.

In a finite well, the energy levels are determined by solving the Schrödinger equation, and for the ground state (n=1), the condition involves the tangent function. The formula is something like:

tan(k a) = (m (V - E) a²)/(ħ²) * (something), but I might be mixing up the terms.

Alternatively, the general approach for the finite well is to solve for the wavevector k, where k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the ground state energy in a finite rectangular well is given by:

E = (ħ² k²) / (2m) ) [but adjusted for the boundary conditions and the finite depth].

Wait, but perhaps it's better to use the formula for the finite well. For a finite rectangular well, the energy levels are found by solving:

tan(k a) = (sqrt(2m (V - E)) ) / (k ) ), where k is the wavevector inside the well.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the boundary conditions lead to:

tan(k a) = (sqrt(2m (V - E)) ) / (k ) )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the first excited state in a finite well, but since the problem is about the lowest energy level, maybe it's better to approach it using the infinite well formula, but that gave me 0.354 nm, which isn't one of the options exactly. The closest is option G: 0.350 nm, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the infinite well formula, but the answer isn't matching exactly, so maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's use the formula in terms of eV and nanometers, perhaps using some constants in convenient units.

I recall that for an infinite well, the energy levels can be expressed as:

E_n (eV) = (n² * 12.400 ) / (a (nm))² )

Wait, where 12.400 comes from h²/(8m e a₀²) in eV and nm units.

Wait, let me check that formula.

The formula E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m a² )

We can express h in eVs and a in nm.

h = 4.135667696e-15 eV·s.

But when we square h, we get h² = (4.135667696e-15)^2 eV²·s².

m is the mass of the electron: 9.10938356e-31 kg.

But perhaps it's easier to use the formula in terms of eV and nm.

Wait, I think I remember that the constant comes out to 12.400 eV·nm² when using E in eV and a in nm.

So E (eV) = (n² * 12.400 ) / (a (nm))² )

So for n=1, E_1 = 12.400 / a².

Given E_1 =3 eV,

3 = 12.400 / a² → a²=12.400 /3 ≈4.1333 → a= sqrt(4.1333) ≈2.033 nm.

Wait, that's 2.033 nm, which isn't any of the options. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the constant.

Wait, maybe the correct value is 12.400 eV·nm², but wait, that would give a larger a, which doesn't fit the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for E in eV and a in nm is E = (n² * 12.400 ) / a².

So 3 = 12.400 / a² → a²=12.400/3≈4.133 → a≈2.033 nm, which is way larger than any of the options. That can't be right. So perhaps I messed up the constant.

Wait, maybe the correct constant is 124.00 eV·Å², but then a is in angstroms.

Wait, 1 nm = 10 angstroms, so if a is in nm, and the constant is 124.00 eV·Å², then to convert to nm, we have 124 eV·(0.1 nm)^2 = 124 * 0.01 eV·nm² = 1.24 eV·nm².

So then the formula becomes E = (n² * 1.24 ) / a².

So E_1 =3 eV = (1² *1.24 ) / a² → a²=1.24/3≈0.4133 → a≈sqrt(0.4133)= approx 0.6428 nm, which is still not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong constant. Let me double-check.

Another approach: compute the constant in the formula E = (n² h²)/(8 m a²) where E in eV, a in nm.

h=6.626e-34 J·s =6.626e-34 (kg·m²/s²)·s =6.626e-34 kg·m²/s.

But to convert to eV·s, since 1 eV =1.602e-19 J, so h=6.626e-34 J·s =6.626e-34 /1.602e-19 eV·s ≈4.138e-15 eV·s.

So h=4.138e-15 eV·s.

Now, h² = (4.138e-15)^2 eV²·s² ≈1.711e-29 eV²·s².

Mass m=9.109e-31 kg.

So 8 m =8 *9.109e-31 =7.287e-30 kg.

Now, E in eV = (h² / (8 m a²)) * (1/(e conversion)) ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute the entire expression:

E (in eV) = (n² h²) / (8 m a²) ) / (1.602e19 J/eV)

Wait, because E in J is h²/(8 m a²), and to convert to eV, divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV.

Wait, let's put it all together.

E (eV) = [ (h^2) / (8 m a^2) ) ] / (1.602e-19 J/eV )

But h is in J·s, so h^2 is J²·s².

So,

E (eV) = [ ( (6.626e-34 J·s)^2 ) / (8 *9.109e-31 kg * a^2 (m)^2) ) ] / (1.602e-19 J/eV )

Simplify numerator:

(6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67 J²·s².

Denominator:8 *9.109e-31 =7.287e-30 kg.

So denominator in the fraction is 7.287e-30 kg * a^2 (m^2).

So,

E (eV) = (4.39e-67 J²·s² ) / (7.287e-30 kg * a^2 m^2) ) / 1.602e-19 J/eV.

Simplify units:

J²·s² / (kg·m²) ) * (1/J) ) → (J·s²)/(kg·m²·J) )= s²/(kg·m²·J^{-1}).

Wait, perhaps better to compute the numerical value.

Let me compute the constants:

Numerator:4.39e-67 /7.287e-30 = (4.39/7.287) *1e^(-67+30)= ~0.602 *1e-37 =6.02e-38.

Now, divide by 1.602e-19:

6.02e-38 /1.602e-19 ≈3.76e-19.

So E (eV) = 3.76e-19 / a^2 (m^2).

But a is in nm, so a (m) = a_nm *1e-9 m.

So a^2 = (a_nm *1e-9)^2 =a_nm² *1e-18 m².

Thus,

E =3.76e-19 / (a_nm² *1e-18) ) =3.76e-19 *1e18 /a_nm² = (3.76e-1) / a_nm² =0.376 /a_nm².

So,

E =0.376 / a_nm².

Given E_1=3 eV,

3 =0.376 / a_nm² → a_nm²=0.376/3≈0.1253 → a_nm≈sqrt(0.1253)= approx 0.354 nm.

Wait, that's the same as before. So a≈0.354 nm, which would correspond to option G:0.350 nm.

But in the options, option H is 0.264 nm, which is about 0.264.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation because the well is finite, not infinite. So the formula I used is for the infinite well, but the problem is about a finite well.

In that case, the approach would be different. Let me think about the finite potential well.

In a finite rectangular well, the bound states are found by solving the equation:

tan(k a) = (sqrt(2m(V - E)) )/(k)

where k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Wait, but perhaps a better way is to use the formula for the ground state energy in a finite well. The formula involves the well depth and the energy.

The general approach is to solve for the energy E such that the wavefunction satisfies the boundary conditions inside and outside the well. For the lowest energy level, the solution involves the first solution where the tangent function equals a certain value derived from the well parameters.

The formula for the ground state energy in a finite well is more complex than the infinite case. The energy levels are determined by solving:

tan(k a) = ( (m (V - E) a² ) ) / (ħ²) ) * (1/(k) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the relation between the wave vectors inside and outside the well.

Let me denote:

k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ,

and

K = sqrt(2m(V - E))/ħ,

where V is the depth of the well (20 eV), and E is the energy of the electron (3 eV).

So, K = sqrt(2m(V - E))/ħ.

In a finite well, the boundary conditions lead to:

tan(k a) = (K/k) * (something), but I think the exact condition is:

tan(k a) = ( (m (V - E) a² ) ) / (ħ² k )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

tan(k a) = (m (V - E) a² )/( ħ² k )

Which can be rearranged as:

tan(k a) = (m (V - E) a² )/( ħ² k )

But this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the ground state energy in a finite well, which is given by:

E = ( (n π ħ)^2 )/(2 m a² ) ) [1/(1 + (something)) ]

Wait, perhaps I should look for a more precise formula.

The general solution for a finite well leads to an equation involving sine and cosine terms. For the ground state (n=1), the equation is:

tan(k a) = (m (V - E) a² )/( ħ² k )

But perhaps it's easier to use the formula:

(k) a = arctan( (m (V - E) a² )/( ħ² k ) )

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can make an approximation or find a way to solve for a.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximate formula for the ground state energy in a finite well. The ground state energy E is given by:

E = ( (n π ħ)^2 )/(2 m a² ) ) * (1/(1 + (m a (V - E))^{1/2}/(π ħ)) )

But this might not be helpful without knowing a.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the well is narrow, and use the approximation for the ground state energy.

But perhaps the simplest approach is to use the given hint: tanθ = sinθ / cosθ.

Wait, perhaps the solution involves the transcendental equation for the finite well, which for the ground state (n=1) would involve:

tan(k a) = (m (V - E) a² )/( ħ² k )

Now, plugging in the known values:

V=20 eV,

E=3 eV,

so V-E=17 eV.

We can express m in kg, a in meters, ħ in J·s.

But this seems complicated, so perhaps it's better to use natural units where ħ=1, m=1, etc., but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the equation as:

tan(k a) = (m (V - E) a² )/( ħ² k )

Let me compute each term.

First, compute k:

k = sqrt(2m E)/ħ.

E=3 eV =3 *1.602e-19 J=4.806e-19 J.

m=9.109e-31 kg.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So,

k = sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 kg *4.806e-19 J ) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s )

Compute numerator inside sqrt:

2 *9.109e-31 *4.806e-19 = 2*9.109*4.806e-50 ≈ 87.76e-50 =8.776e-49 kg·J.

But J=kg·m²/s², so inside sqrt: 8.776e-49 kg²·m²/s².

So sqrt(8.776e-49)= approx 9.37e-25 m/s.

Then divide by ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k=9.37e-25 /1.0545718e-34 ≈8.88e9 m^-1.

So k≈8.88e9 m^-1.

Now, compute the right-hand side (RHS):

(m (V - E) a² )/( ħ² k )

V-E=17 eV =17 *1.602e-19 J=2.7234e-18 J.

So,

RHS = (9.109e-31 kg *2.7234e-18 J *a² ) / ( (1.0545718e-34 J·s)^2 *8.88e9 m^-1 )

Let me compute the denominator first:

(1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈1.112e-68 J²·s².

Multiply by 8.88e9 m^-1: 1.112e-68 *8.88e9 =9.88e-59 J²·s²·m^-1.

Now the numerator:

9.109e-31 *2.7234e-18 = approx 2.483e-48 kg·J.

Multiply by a²: 2.483e-48 *a².

So RHS= (2.483e-48 *a²) / (9.88e-59 ) ) = (2.483 /9.88) *1e^( -48 +59 ) *a².

2.483/9.88≈0.251.

1e^(11) =1e11.

So RHS≈0.251e11 *a² =2.51e10 *a².

So the equation is:

tan(k a) = 2.51e10 *a².

But k=8.88e9 m^-1, so k a=8.88e9 *a.

So,

tan(8.88e9 *a )=2.51e10 *a².

This seems tricky because it's a transcendental equation, but perhaps we can make an approximation for small a.

If a is small, then 8.88e9 *a is small, so tan(x)≈x.

So,

8.88e9 a ≈2.51e10 a² → 8.88e9 a =2.51e10 a² → dividing both sides by a (assuming a≠0),

8.88e9 =2.51e10 a → a=8.88e9 /2.51e10 ≈0.354 m.

Wait, that's 0.354 meters, which is way too big because the options are in nanometers. So that can't be right. Therefore, the approximation tan(x)≈x isn't valid here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can try to find a solution where 8.88e9 a is a small angle, but given that a is in nanometers, 8.88e9 * a (in meters) would be 8.88e9 * a_nm *1e-9 =8.88 *a_nm.

So, if a is 0.3 nm, then 8.88 *0.3=2.664 radians, which is about 152 degrees, so tan(2.664)≈-0.567. But the RHS for a=0.3 nm would be 2.51e10 * (0.3)^2 =2.51e10 *0.09=2.259e9.

So tan(k a)= -0.567 ≈2.259e9 → which isn't possible. So that approach doesn't work.

Hmm, perhaps I need to use numerical methods or trial and error to find a that satisfies the equation tan(8.88e9 a) =2.51e10 a².

But this seems too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the infinite well formula, leading to a=0.354 nm, which is option G:0.350 nm. However, the options don't have 0.354. The closest is option G:0.350 nm.

Wait, but looking back, in the initial calculation using the infinite well formula, I got a≈0.354 nm, which rounds to 0.35 nm, matching option G.

But another thought: perhaps the problem intended for the infinite well formula, and the mention of the hint about tanθ is a red herring, or perhaps it's meant for a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is indeed about an infinite well, and the answer is 0.354 nm, so option G:0.350 nm is the closest, but perhaps the exact calculation gives a=0.354 nm, which isn't an option, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the infinite well calculation.

Using the formula E = (n² h²)/(8 m a² )

We have E=3 eV, n=1.

So a = h / sqrt(8 m E )

Wait, wait, no, a = h / sqrt(8 m E ) * something.

Wait, let me recompute the infinite well case.

E = (h² n² )/(8 m a² )

So solving for a:

a² = h² n² / (8 m E )

a = h n / sqrt(8 m E )

Plugging in the numbers:

h=6.626e-34 J·s,

n=1,

m=9.109e-31 kg,

E=3 eV =4.806e-19 J.

So,

a= (6.626e-34 *1 ) / sqrt(8 *9.109e-31 *4.806e-19 )

Compute denominator:

8 *9.109e-31 =7.287e-30,

7.287e-30 *4.806e-19 =3.502e-48.

sqrt(3.502e-48 ) = approx 5.918e-24.

So a=6.626e-34 /5.918e-24 ≈1.12e-10 m =0.112 nm.

Wait, that's 0.112 nm, which is option E:0.100 nm, but 0.112 is closer to option I:0.125 nm.

Wait, but this contradicts my earlier calculation. What's happening here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula with h in eV·s.

h=4.135667696e-15 eV·s.

So, using E in eV,

E = (h² n² )/(8 m a² )

But m is in kg, so perhaps I should express m in terms of eV/c².

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of eV and nm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula when using E in eV and a in nm is:

E = (12.4 )^2 / a² → E (eV) = (12.4)^2 / (a (nm))^2.

So for E=3 eV,

3 = (12.4)^2 /a² → a² = (12.4)^2 /3 → 153.76 /3 ≈51.253 → a≈7.16 nm.

But that's much larger than the options, so I must be using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is E = (h² n²)/(8 m a² ), but with E in eV and a in nm.

Let me compute the constants again.

h=6.626e-34 J·s,

m=9.109e-31 kg,

E=3 eV=4.806e-19 J,

n=1.

a² = h²/(8 m E )

Compute numerator: h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈4.39e-67 J²·s².

Denominator:8 *9.109e-31 *4.806e-19 =8 *9.109e-31 *4.806e-19.

Compute 8 *9.109e-31 =7.287e-30,

7.287e-30 *4.806e-19 =3.502e-48 J·kg.

So a² =4.39e-67 /3.502e-48 =1.253e-19 m².

a= sqrt(1.253e-19 )= approx 3.54e-10 m=0.354 nm.

So, that brings me back to the initial calculation of a≈0.354 nm, which is option G:0.350 nm.

But wait, the options don't have 0.354, but option H is 0.264 nm, which is significantly smaller. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is indeed about a finite well, and the correct approach involves the transcendental equation. Given that, perhaps the correct width is around 0.264 nm, which is option H.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the finite well's ground state.

The energy levels for a finite well are found by solving:

tan(k a) = (m (V - E) a² )/( ħ^2 k )

Let me try to solve this numerically.

We have:

V=20 eV,

E=3 eV,

so V-E=17 eV.

We can write the equation as:

tan(k a) = [ m (V - E) a² ] / ( ħ^2 k )

Let me express all terms in SI units.

m=9.109e-31 kg,

V-E=17 eV=17 *1.602e-19 J=2.7234e-18 J,

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So,

tan(k a) = [9.109e-31 kg * 2.7234e-18 J * a² ] / [ (1.0545718e-34 J·s)^2 *k ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator:9.109e-31 *2.7234e-18 =2.483e-48 kg·J.

Denominator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 =1.112e-68 J²·s².

So,

tan(k a) = [2.483e-48 *a² ] / [1.112e-68 *k ]

Simplify:

tan(k a) = (2.483e-48 /1.112e-68 ) * (a² /k ) = 2.23e20 * (a² /k )

So,

tan(k a)=2.23e20 *a² /k.

But k= sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Compute k:

E=3 eV=4.806e-19 J,

k= sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *4.806e-19 ) /1.0545718e-34.

Compute inside sqrt:

2 *9.109e-31 *4.806e-19 =8.776e-49,

sqrt(8.776e-49 )=9.37e-25 m^-1.

So,

k=9.37e-25 /1.0545718e-34 ≈8.88e9 m^-1.

So,

tan(k a)=2.23e20 *a²/(8.88e9 )

= (2.23e20 /8.88e9 ) *a²

=2.51e10 *a².

So,

tan(8.88e9 *a )=2.51e10 *a².

This is a transcendental equation, which is difficult to solve analytically. Let's make an initial guess for a and iterate.

Assume a is around 0.3 nm (3e-10 m).

Compute 8.88e9 *3e-10 =2.664 radians.

tan(2.664)≈-0.567.

Compute RHS:2.51e10 * (3e-10)^2=2.51e10 *9e-20=2.259e-10.

So LHS≈-0.567 vs RHS≈2.259e-10 → not matching.

So, perhaps a is smaller.

Try a=0.264 nm (option H).

Compute 8.88e9 *0.264e-9=2.353 radians.

tan(2.353)≈-0.072 (since tan(2.353)=tan(135 degrees - about 1.8 radians)= negative small value).

Compute RHS:2.51e10*(0.264e-9)^2=2.51e10*(6.9696e-20)=1.746e-9.

So LHS≈-0.072, RHS≈1.746e-9 → not matching.

Wait, perhaps try a=0.2 nm.

k a=8.88e9 *0.2e-9=1.776 radians.

tan(1.776)≈-0.0039 (since tan(1.776)=tan(pi -1.366)= -tan(1.366)= -3.6 → Wait, wait, 1.776 radians is approximately 101.8 degrees. Wait, tan(1.776)= tan(101.8 degrees) ≈-3.6.

But wait, let me compute it accurately.

1.776 radians is approximately 101.8 degrees (since pi/2=1.5708 rad=90 degrees, and 1.776-1.5708=0.2052 rad≈11.77 degrees, so 90+11.77=101.77 degrees).

tan(101.77 degrees)=tan(90+11.77)= -cot(11.77 degrees)≈-4.69.

So LHS≈-4.69.

RHS=2.51e10*(0.2e-9)^2=2.51e10*4e-20=1.004e-9.

So LHS≈-4.69 vs RHS≈1.004e-9 → not matching.

Hmm, perhaps a=0.150 nm.

k a=8.88e9 *0.150e-9=1.332 radians.

tan(1.332)= approx 4.33.

RHS=2.51e10*(0.15e-9)^2=2.51e10*2.25e-20=5.6475e-10.

So LHS=4.33 vs RHS=5.6475e-10 → not matching.

Hmm, perhaps a=0.100 nm.

k a=8.88e9 *0.1e-9=0.888 radians.

tan(0.888)= approx 1.25.

RHS=2.51e10*(0.1e-9)^2=2.51e10*1e-20=2.51e-10.

So LHS=1.25 vs RHS=2.51e-10 → not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should try a=0.264 nm again.

k a=8.88e9 *0.264e-9=2.353 radians.

tan(2.353)= approx -0.072.

RHS=2.51e10*(0.264e-9)^2=2.51e10*(6.9696e-20)=1.746e-9.

So LHS≈-0.072 vs RHS=1.746e-9 → LHS is much larger in magnitude.

Wait, perhaps the solution is when a is smaller, say a=0.175 nm (option D).

k a=8.88e9 *0.175e-9=1.554 radians.

tan(1.554)= approx 15.43.

RHS=2.51e10*(0.175e-9)^2=2.51e10*(3.0625e-20)=7.68e-10.

So LHS=15.43 vs RHS=7.68e-10 → not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I need to try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can write the equation as:

tan(k a) = (m (V - E) a² )/( ħ² k )

But I can rearrange this as:

tan(k a) * k = (m (V - E) a² )/( ħ² )

Let me compute the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) for various a.

Let me try a=0.264 nm (option H):

k a=8.88e9 *0.264e-9=2.353 radians.

tan(2.353)= approx -0.072.

So LHS= tan(2.353)*k= (-0.072)*8.88e9≈-6.40e8.

RHS= (9.109e-31 kg * 17 eV * (0.264e-9 m)^2 ) / ( (1.0545718e-34 J·s)^2 )

Wait, but I should compute it in SI units.

E=3 eV, V=20 eV, so V-E=17 eV =17 *1.602e-19 J=2.723e-18 J.

Compute RHS:

(m (V-E) a² ) / (ħ² )

= (9.109e-31 kg *2.723e-18 J * (0.264e-9 m)^2 ) / ( (1.0545718e-34 J·s)^2 )

= (9.109e-31 *2.723e-18 *6.9696e-20 ) / (1.112e-68 )

Compute numerator:

9.109e-31 *2.723e-18 ≈2.483e-48,

2.483e-48 *6.9696e-20 ≈1.728e-67.

Denominator:1.112e-68.

So RHS=1.728e-67 /1.112e-68≈15.54.

So,

LHS= -6.40e8,

RHS=15.54.

These are not equal. So a=0.264 nm doesn't satisfy the equation.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the infinite well formula, leading to a=0.354 nm (option G), but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H:0.264 nm.

But given the time I've spent and the calculations, I'll proceed with the infinite well approach, which gives a=0.354 nm, closest to option G:0.350 nm.
</think>

The problem involves determining the width of a rectangular potential well where the lowest energy level is 3.00 eV above the bottom, and the well depth is 20.0 eV. The analysis begins by considering the energy levels in an infinite potential well, where the formula for the energy levels is:

\[
E_n = \frac{n^2 h^2}{8 m a^2}
\]

Here, \(E_1 = 3 \, \text{eV}\), \(n = 1\), \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\), and \(a\) is the width of the well. Rearranging for \(a\):

\[
a = \sqrt{\frac{h^2}{8 m E_1}}
\]

Converting \(E_1\) to joules (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)), the calculation yields:

\[
a \approx 0.354 \, \text{nm}
\]

This value is closest to option G (\(0.350 \, \text{nm}\)).

The problem also hints at a finite potential well, where the energy levels are determined by solving a transcendental equation involving the tangent function. However, the calculations for the finite well are more complex and lead to inconsistencies with the provided options. Thus, the infinite well formula is assumed to be the intended approach.

Given the calculations and the provided options, the width of the well is approximately \(0.350 \, \text{nm}\).
