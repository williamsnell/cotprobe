Question:

Which of the following statements about the DNA in one of your liver cells is correct?

Options:

A: DNA in your liver cells contains genes unique to storing glycogen, while other cells do not contain those genes.
B: The DNA in your liver cells is only used for the production of liver enzymes.
C: The DNA in your liver cells is different from the DNA in your other cells.
D: Your liver cells contain the same DNA as your red blood cells, but not your white blood cells.
E: Most of the DNA in your liver cells will be transcribed but not translated.
F: The DNA in your liver cells only contains genes for liver-specific functions.
G: Your liver cells contain less DNA than your white blood cells.
H: Most of the DNA in your liver cells will be transcribed in the nucleus and translated in the cytoplasm.
I: DNA in your liver cells is primarily transcribed in the cytoplasm and translated in the nucleus.
J: Your liver cells contain the same DNA as your white blood cells.

Okay, so I've got this question about DNA in liver cells, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question is asking about the DNA in one of my liver cells. The options are A through J, so I need to evaluate each statement.

Option A: "DNA in your liver cells contains genes unique to storing glycogen, while other cells do not contain those genes." Hmm, I remember that all cells in the body have the same set of DNA, but only certain genes are expressed. So, liver cells have genes for glycogen storage, but so do other cellsâ€”those genes are just not active in other cells. So A might not be correct because the genes aren't unique to liver cells; they're just expressed there.

Option B: "The DNA in your liver cells is only used for the production of liver enzymes." No, that doesn't sound right. DNA is used for all kinds of functions, not just enzymes. Liver cells produce proteins for various functions, not just enzymes. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: "The DNA in your liver cells is different from the DNA in your other cells." Wait, no, all cells have the same DNA. They just express different genes. So C is incorrect.

Option D: "Your liver cells contain the same DNA as your red blood cells, but not your white blood cells." That doesn't make sense because all cells (except maybe red blood cells which lose their nucleus) have the same DNA. So D is incorrect, as liver and white blood cells should have the same DNA too.

Option E: "Most of the DNA in your liver cells will be transcribed but not translated." I'm a bit confused here. DNA is transcribed into RNA, and RNA is translated into protein. But in the nucleus, DNA is being transcribed, but the majority of the DNA isn't necessarily being used at any given time. So most DNA isn't transcribed, but the DNA that's being used is. So E might not be correct because it's not that most DNA is transcribed.

Option F: "The DNA in your liver cells only contains genes for liver-specific functions." No, the DNA has all the genes, but only some are expressed. So F is incorrect because the DNA isn't only for liver functions.

Option G: "Your liver cells contain less DNA than your white blood cells." No, all cells have the same amount of DNA (assuming the organism is eukaryotic and they are diploid). So G is wrong.

Option H: "Most of the DNA in your liver cells will be transcribed in the nucleus and translated in the cytoplasm." Wait, transcription happens in the nucleus, and translation in the cytoplasm. But most DNA isn't transcribed at once. So H suggests that most DNA is being transcribed, which isn't accurate. Most DNA remains untranscribed, so H is incorrect.

Option I: "DNA in your liver cells is primarily transcribed in the cytoplasm and translated in the nucleus." That doesn't make sense because transcription happens in the nucleus, not the cytoplasm. So I is wrong.

Option J: "Your liver cells contain the same DNA as your white blood cells." Yes, because all cells have the same DNA (assuming it's a diploid organism and not considering mutations). So J seems correct.

Wait, but I thought Option J says "same DNA as your white blood cells." But wait, white blood cells are a type of blood cell, and liver cells are different. But all somatic cells have the same DNA unless there are mutations. So J is correct because both liver and white blood cells have the same DNA.

Wait, but let me double-check. The statement in J is that liver cells have the same DNA as white blood cells. Yes, that's correct because they're both diploid cells with the same genome, except for things like the presence of a nucleus in liver cells (white blood cells, like neutrophils, have a nucleus as well). So J is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought about Option H and E. Let me think again.

Option E: "Most of the DNA in your liver cells will be transcribed but not translated." No, because transcription is the process of making RNA from DNA, but most DNA isn't being transcribed at any moment. Only a small portion is. So E is incorrect.

Option H says most DNA is transcribed and translated, which isn't true. So the correct answer is J.

The correct answer is J: Your liver cells contain the same DNA as your white blood cells.

Answer: J
