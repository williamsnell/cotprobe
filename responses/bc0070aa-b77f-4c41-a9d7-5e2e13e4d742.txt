Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how long it will take for the rocket to lift off the ground. Hmm, the question gives me a bunch of parameters: initial mass, mass ratio, burning rate, and exhaust velocity. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that mass ratio is the ratio of the initial mass to the final mass. So the mass ratio is 3, which means the final mass is initial mass divided by 3. The initial mass is 2e4 kg, so final mass would be 2e4 / 3 ≈ 6666.67 kg. That makes sense because the rocket is shedding a lot of mass as it burns fuel.

The burning rate is 100 kg/sec. So every second, the rocket loses 100 kg of mass. I think the time the rocket takes to lift off is when the thrust from the engines overcomes the gravitational force pulling it down. But wait, when does it actually leave the ground? Oh right, that's when the thrust is greater than the weight of the rocket at that moment.

Wait, but the rocket's mass is changing over time. So the weight is mass times gravity. Gravity on Earth is about 9.8 m/s². So the weight at any time t would be (initial mass minus the mass burned) times g. The thrust, I think, is the exhaust velocity multiplied by the burning rate. So Thrust = v_e * (dm/dt). Here, dm/dt is the burning rate, which is 100 kg/s, and v_e is 980 m/s.

So Thrust = 980 * 100 = 98,000 N. Wait, but this is constant because the burning rate and exhaust velocity are constant. So the thrust is a constant 98,000 N.

Now, the rocket will lift off when the thrust equals the weight at that time. So set Thrust = weight at time t. So 98,000 = (initial mass - mass burned) * g.

Mass burned at time t is burning rate * t, which is 100t kg. So the mass at time t is 2e4 - 100t. So weight is (2e4 - 100t) * 9.8.

So equation: 98,000 = (2e4 - 100t) * 9.8.

Let me compute that. First, divide both sides by 9.8:

98,000 / 9.8 = (2e4 - 100t)
98,000 ÷ 9.8 is 10,000. So 10,000 = 2e4 - 100t.

Now, rearrange: 100t = 2e4 - 10,000 = 10,000. So t = 10,000 / 100 = 100 seconds.

Wait, that's one of the options. Option C is 100 sec. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the rocket needs to overcome the weight at lift-off. So when the thrust equals the weight, that's when it starts to accelerate upwards. So the time should be when thrust equals weight, which is at 100 seconds. But wait, that seems a bit long. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the net force. The thrust is 98,000 N upwards, and the weight is (2e4 - 100t)*9.8. When the rocket's acceleration becomes positive, it will lift off. But perhaps the moment when the thrust equals the weight is when it starts to accelerate upwards, so that's when it leaves the ground.

Wait, but the initial mass is 2e4 kg. So initial weight is 2e4 *9.8 = 196,000 N. The thrust is 98,000 N, which is less than the initial weight. So at t=0, thrust is less than weight, so rocket is still on the ground. As time increases, mass decreases, so weight decreases. So when does 98,000 = (2e4 - 100t)*9.8?

As I did before, that gives t=100 seconds. So at t=100 sec, the thrust equals the weight, so the rocket will start to accelerate upwards. So the time to lift off is 100 seconds.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is 100 sec. So the answer should be C.

The rocket will lift off when the thrust from its engines equals the gravitational force acting on it. Using the given parameters, the thrust is calculated as 98,000 N, and the gravitational force decreases over time as the rocket's mass decreases. Solving for the time when thrust equals weight, we find that the rocket will lift off after 100 seconds.
