Okay, so I have this question here: What percent is 131 of 42? Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on percentages, but I think I remember that to find what percent one number is of another, I need to use the formula (part/whole) * 100%. 

So, the part is 131, and the whole is 42. Wait, wait a second. Does it make sense that 131 is a part of 42? Because 42 is less than 131, wouldn't that make the percentage more than 100%? Or am I getting this reversed?

Wait, no, I think I got it wrong. Actually, the "whole" is the number you're comparing to, so in this case, 42 is the whole. The part is 131, which is the portion we're interested in. Oh wait, no, wait again. Let's think: if I want to know what percent 131 is of 42, I think that 42 is the base, and 131 is the amount. But wait, 131 is bigger than 42, which would mean that 131 is more than the whole, so the percentage should be over 100%. 

So, applying the formula: (131 / 42) * 100% equals what? Let me calculate that. 

131 divided by 42. Let's see, 42 times 3 is 126, which is 3*42=126. So 131 minus 126 is 5. So 3 with a remainder of 5, which is 3 and 5/42. 

5 divided by 42 is approximately 0.119. So 3.119. Multiply by 100% gives approximately 311.9%. 

Looking at the options, option J is 311.9%. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check the formula. Oh, wait, no, I think I might have mixed up the part and the whole. Let me make sure. 

Wait, no, the formula is (part/whole) *100. Here, part is 131, whole is 42. So 131/42 is correct. I think I did that right. So 311.9% is the right answer. So the correct option is J: 311.9%. Yes, that's what I thought earlier.
