Okay, so I need to figure out Aisha's monthly retirement annuity payout. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slowly.

First, Aisha is saving $1000 each quarter for 30 years. That means she's making regular contributions, right? And during this time, the account earns 6% interest compounded quarterly. So I think I need to calculate the future value of her savings after 30 years. Then, once she retires, she'll start withdrawing money as an annuity for 25 years, and the account will earn 4.8% interest compounded monthly. So I need to find out how much she can withdraw each month.

Let me start with the savings phase. She saves $1000 every quarter. Since there are four quarters in a year, the number of contributions she makes over 30 years is 30 * 4 = 120 quarters. Each contribution is $1000, so that's straightforward.

The interest rate is 6% annually, compounded quarterly. So the quarterly interest rate would be 6% divided by 4, which is 1.5% or 0.015 in decimal. 

The formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity (where contributions are made at the end of each period) is:

FV = PMT * [( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ]

Where:
- FV = future value
- PMT = periodic payment ($1000)
- r = periodic interest rate (0.015)
- n = number of periods (120)

So plugging in the numbers:

FV = 1000 * [ ( (1 + 0.015)^120 - 1 ) / 0.015 ]

I need to calculate (1.015)^120 first. Let me think, that's the same as e^(120 * ln(1.015)). But maybe I can approximate it or use a calculator. Alternatively, I can remember that the future value factor for 6% quarterly over 30 years is a standard value. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step.

Wait, alternatively, since this is a standard calculation, maybe I can use a financial calculator formula. But since I'm doing it manually, let me compute (1.015)^120.

But maybe I can use logarithms or approximate. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that (1.015)^4 is approximately 1.06136, which is the annual rate. Since 6% annual rate is 0.06, and 1.015^4 is about 1.06136, which is a bit more than 6%. So over 30 years, the future value would be (1.06136)^30. Let me compute that.

Wait, 30 years, so 30 periods of annual compounding at 6.136%. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the future value correctly using the quarterly rate.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute (1.015)^120. Let me compute this step by step.

Taking natural log: ln(1.015) ≈ 0.014816. Multiply by 120: 0.014816 * 120 ≈ 1.7779. So e^1.7779 ≈ 5.90. Wait, that can't be right because (1.015)^120 should be much higher. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the natural log approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for compound interest. Alternatively, maybe I can use logarithms more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as:

(1.015)^120 = e^(120 * ln(1.015)).

Using a calculator, ln(1.015) ≈ 0.014816. So 120 * 0.014816 ≈ 1.77792. Then e^1.77792 ≈ 5.90 (approximately). Wait, but that seems low. Let me check with another method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the rule of 72 to estimate how many years it takes to double at 6% annual rate. Wait, but that's for annual compounding, not quarterly. But maybe that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for future value with compound interest. Let me try to compute (1.015)^120.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it in parts. Let's compute (1.015)^10, then raise that to the 12th power.

(1.015)^10 ≈ 1.16049 (since 1.015^10 is approximately 1.16049).

Then (1.16049)^12. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as (1.16049)^12 ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps I can compute it step by step:

1.16049^2 ≈ 1.34687.

1.34687^2 ≈ 1.8140.

1.8140^3 ≈ 1.8140 * 1.8140 = ~3.2909, then *1.8140 ≈ 5.970.

Hmm, so that's after 12 years, so 1.015^120 ≈ 5.970. So the factor is about 5.97.

Wait, but let me check that again. Wait, 1.015^120 is (1.015^4)^30, which is (1.06136)^30. So 1.06136^30.

To compute 1.06136^30, perhaps I can compute it as:

First, compute the natural log of 1.06136: ln(1.06136) ≈ 0.05953.

Multiply by 30: 0.05953 * 30 ≈ 1.7858. Then e^1.7858 ≈ 5.96 (since e^1.6094 is about 5, e^1.7918 is about 6, so 5.96 sounds right).

So the future value factor is approximately 5.96. So FV = 1000 * 5.96 = 596,000? Wait, that can't be right because each $1000 contributes 5.96 times its amount, so 1000 * 5.96 = $596,000. That seems high, but let me check.

Wait, but actually, the future value formula is FV = PMT * [ ((1 + r)^n - 1) / r ].

So let me compute ((1.015)^120 - 1) / 0.015.

We have (1.015)^120 ≈ 5.970.

So (5.970 - 1) = 4.970.

Divide by 0.015: 4.970 / 0.015 ≈ 331.333.

Then FV = 1000 * 331.333 ≈ $331,333.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the total amount saved after 30 years is approximately $331,333.

Wait, but I thought (1.015)^120 was about 5.97. So ((5.97 -1)/0.015) = 4.97 / 0.015 ≈ 331.333. So yes, FV ≈ $331,333.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. Because if each $1000 grows to about 5.97 times, then each $1000 contributes 5.97 * 1000 = $5,970. But since she's contributing every quarter, the total FV is the sum of all these contributions grown to the end.

But wait, no, because the formula already accounts for the time value of each contribution. So the FV is indeed $331,333.

So after 30 years, she has about $331,333 in her retirement account.

Now, she wants to withdraw this amount as an annuity that pays a constant amount every month for 25 years. During the payout phase, the account earns 4.8% interest compounded monthly.

So now, I need to compute the monthly annuity payout. This is an ordinary annuity where she withdraws a fixed amount each month, and the present value is the FV from the savings phase, which is $331,333.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Where:
- PV = present value ($331,333)
- PMT = monthly payment (what we're solving for)
- r = monthly interest rate
- n = number of payments (25 years * 12 months/year = 300 months)

The interest rate during the payout phase is 4.8% annually, compounded monthly. So the monthly interest rate is 4.8% / 12 = 0.4% or 0.004 in decimal.

We can rearrange the PV formula to solve for PMT:

PMT = PV / [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

So plugging in the numbers:

PMT = 331333 / [ (1 - (1 + 0.004)^-300 ) / 0.004 ]

First, compute (1 + 0.004)^-300.

(1.004)^300 is the same as e^(300 * ln(1.004)). Let's compute ln(1.004) ≈ 0.0039976. Multiply by 300: 0.0039976 * 300 ≈ 1.19928. So e^1.19928 ≈ 3.305. Therefore, (1.004)^300 ≈ 3.305, so (1.004)^-300 ≈ 1/3.305 ≈ 0.3025.

Wait, but let me check that again. Because (1.004)^300 is indeed e^(300 * ln(1.004)) ≈ e^(300 * 0.0039976) ≈ e^1.19928 ≈ 3.305. So 1/3.305 ≈ 0.3025.

So now, compute 1 - 0.3025 = 0.6975.

Then, divide that by 0.004: 0.6975 / 0.004 = 174.375.

So PMT = 331,333 / 174.375 ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

331,333 ÷ 174.375 ≈ Let's see, 174.375 * 1900 = ?

174.375 * 1000 = 174,375

174.375 * 2000 = 348,750, which is more than 331,333.

So 331,333 ÷ 174.375 ≈ let's compute 331333 ÷ 174.375.

Dividing step by step:

174.375 * 1900 = 174.375 * 1000=174,375; *2000=348,750. So 1900 gives 174,375 * 1.9 = 331,312.5.

Wait, 174.375 * 1900:

Wait, 174.375 * 1900 = 174.375 * 1000 * 1.9 = 174,375 * 1.9.

174,375 * 1 = 174,375

174,375 * 0.9 = 156,937.5

Total: 174,375 + 156,937.5 = 331,312.5

So 174.375 * 1900 = 331,312.5.

Our PV is 331,333, which is slightly more than 331,312.5. The difference is 331,333 - 331,312.5 = 20.5.

So, 174.375 * 1900 = 331,312.5

To find the additional, 20.5 / 174.375 ≈ 0.1175.

So total PMT ≈ 1900 + 0.1175 ≈ 1900.1175. So approximately $1900.12 per month.

Wait, but looking at the options, the highest is H: 2200, and the next is I:1995. So 1900.12 is close to option I:1995.10, but perhaps my approximation is off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the PV and FV again.

Wait, first, maybe my calculation of FV was incorrect. Let me recalculate the FV.

The quarterly contribution is $1000, 120 quarters, 6% annual rate, compounded quarterly.

The future value formula is FV = PMT * [ ((1 + r)^n -1 ) / r ]

r = 0.06 /4 = 0.015

n = 30*4=120

So ((1.015)^120 -1 ) / 0.015.

We can compute (1.015)^120 precisely. Let me use logarithms.

ln(1.015) ≈ 0.014816.

120 * 0.014816 ≈ 1.7779.

e^1.7779 ≈ 5.90 (as before). Wait, but earlier I thought it was about 5.97, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, e^1.7779: since e^1.6094 is 5, e^1.7918 is 6. So 1.7779 is between 1.6094 and 1.7918. Let's compute e^1.7779.

We can approximate:

At x=1.7779,

We know that e^1.7779 ≈ ?

We can use Taylor series, but perhaps a better way is to use a calculator approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that (1.015)^120 ≈ 5.97.

So ((5.97 -1)/0.015) = 4.97 / 0.015 ≈ 331.333.

So FV ≈ 1000 * 331.333 ≈ $331,333.

Wait, but if I compute (1.015)^120 accurately, perhaps it's higher.

Let me use the formula for compound interest more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for future value of an annuity. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the future value factor.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity:

FV = PMT * [ ((1 + r)^n -1 ) / r ]

So plugging in the numbers:

PMT = 1000

r = 0.015

n = 120

So ((1.015)^120 -1 ) / 0.015.

Let me compute (1.015)^120 using logarithms more accurately.

ln(1.015) = 0.014816045.

Multiply by 120: 0.014816045 * 120 = 1.7779254.

e^1.7779254 = ?

We can use the Taylor series expansion for e^x around x=1.7779.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that e^1.7779 is approximately 5.90.

Wait, let me check with a calculator:

If I compute (1.015)^120:

We can compute step by step using exponentiation by squaring.

But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that (1.015)^120 ≈ 5.97.

So, ((5.97 -1)/0.015) = 4.97 / 0.015 ≈ 331.333.

So FV ≈ $331,333.

Now, moving to the annuity payout phase.

She wants to withdraw a constant amount each month for 25 years, which is 300 months.

The interest rate is 4.8% annually, compounded monthly. So the monthly rate is 4.8% /12 = 0.4% or 0.004.

The present value (PV) of the annuity is the FV from the savings phase, which is $331,333.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We can rearrange to solve for PMT:

PMT = PV / [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Plugging in the numbers:

PV = 331,333

r = 0.004

n = 300

Compute (1 + 0.004)^300:

Again, using logarithms:

ln(1.004) ≈ 0.0039976.

300 * 0.0039976 ≈ 1.19928.

e^1.19928 ≈ 3.305.

So (1.004)^300 ≈ 3.305, so (1.004)^-300 ≈ 1/3.305 ≈ 0.3025.

Then, 1 - 0.3025 = 0.6975.

Divide by 0.004: 0.6975 / 0.004 = 174.375.

So PMT = 331,333 / 174.375.

Let me compute that:

331,333 ÷ 174.375.

Let me compute 174.375 * 1900 = ?

174.375 * 1000 = 174,375

174.375 * 900 = 174,375 * 9 * 100 = 1,569,375 * 100 = 156,937.5

So 174,375 + 156,937.5 = 331,312.5

So 174.375 * 1900 = 331,312.5

Our PV is 331,333, which is 20.5 more than 331,312.5.

So 20.5 / 174.375 ≈ 0.1175.

So PMT ≈ 1900 + 0.1175 ≈ 1900.12.

But looking at the options, the closest is I: 1995.10, which is higher. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the FV calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps my calculation of (1.015)^120 was incorrect. Let me use a more accurate method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (1.015)^120 more accurately. Let me compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the future value factor.

The future value factor for an ordinary annuity is [ ((1 + r)^n -1 ) / r ]

So with r=0.015 and n=120, the factor is [ (1.015^120 -1 ) / 0.015 ]

I think perhaps my previous calculation underestimated this factor.

Wait, let me compute (1.015)^120 more accurately.

We can compute it as follows:

First, compute (1.015)^120 using logarithms:

ln(1.015) ≈ 0.014816045.

Multiply by 120: 0.014816045 * 120 ≈ 1.7779254.

Now, e^1.7779254 ≈ ?

We can use a calculator for this. But since I don't have a calculator, let me use the approximation.

We know that e^1.7779 ≈ 5.90. Wait, but perhaps it's higher.

Wait, e^1.6094 = 5, e^1.7918 = 6.

1.7779 is between these two. Let's see:

Compute e^1.7779:

We can use the Taylor series expansion around x=1.7918.

Alternatively, perhaps I can estimate it as 5.90.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule that (1 + 0.015)^120 ≈ e^(120 * 0.015) = e^1.8 ≈ 6.05, but that's an approximation because it ignores the higher-order terms. So maybe the actual value is higher than 5.90.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it as:

(1.015)^120 = (1.015^40)^3.

Compute 1.015^40 first.

Using logarithms:

ln(1.015) ≈ 0.014816045.

40 * 0.014816045 ≈ 0.5926418.

e^0.5926418 ≈ 1.808.

So (1.015)^40 ≈ 1.808.

Then, (1.808)^3 = ?

1.808 * 1.808 = 3.269.

3.269 * 1.808 ≈ 5.90.

So (1.015)^120 ≈ 5.90.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was about 5.97. Hmm, maybe it's around 5.90.

So, with that, the future value factor is (5.90 -1)/0.015 = 4.90 / 0.015 ≈ 326.6667.

So FV = 1000 * 326.6667 ≈ $326,666.70.

Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

So if FV is $326,666.70, then the PV for the annuity is $326,666.70.

Now, proceeding to calculate the monthly payout.

PMT = PV / [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

r = 0.004

n = 300

Compute (1.004)^300.

Again, using logarithms:

ln(1.004) ≈ 0.0039976.

300 * 0.0039976 ≈ 1.19928.

e^1.19928 ≈ 3.305.

So (1.004)^300 ≈ 3.305.

Thus, (1.004)^-300 ≈ 1/3.305 ≈ 0.3025.

So, 1 - 0.3025 = 0.6975.

Divide by 0.004: 0.6975 / 0.004 = 174.375.

So PMT = 326,666.70 / 174.375 ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

326,666.70 ÷ 174.375.

Compute 174.375 * 1875 = ?

Wait, 174.375 * 1875 = 174.375 * (1000 + 800 + 75) = 174,375 + 139,500 + 13,078.125 = 174,375 + 139,500 = 313,875 + 13,078.125 = 326,953.125.

Wait, that's more than 326,666.70.

So 174.375 * 1875 = 326,953.125.

But our PV is 326,666.70, which is less than that. So 326,666.70 ÷ 174.375 ≈ 1875 - (326,953.125 - 326,666.70)/174.375.

The difference is 326,953.125 - 326,666.70 ≈ 286.425.

So, 286.425 / 174.375 ≈ 1.643.

So, 1875 - 1.643 ≈ 1873.357.

So PMT ≈ $1,873.36 per month.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest higher option is I:1995.10, which is higher than this.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the FV calculation. Alternatively, perhaps my approximation of (1.015)^120 as 5.90 is too low.

Wait, perhaps I can use a more precise value for (1.015)^120.

Using a calculator, (1.015)^120 is approximately 5.970.

So, ((5.970 - 1)/0.015) = 4.970 / 0.015 ≈ 331.333.

So FV = 1000 * 331.333 ≈ $331,333.

Then, PV for the annuity is $331,333.

So PMT = 331,333 / [ (1 - (1.004)^-300 ) / 0.004 ]

We have (1.004)^300 ≈ 3.305, so (1.004)^-300 ≈ 0.3025.

So 1 - 0.3025 = 0.6975.

0.6975 / 0.004 = 174.375.

So PMT = 331,333 / 174.375 ≈ 1900.12.

Looking at the options, the closest is I: 1995.10, which is higher than 1900.12. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating (1.004)^300.

Wait, 4.8% annually, so monthly rate is 0.4% or 0.004.

(1.004)^300 = e^(300 * ln(1.004)).

ln(1.004) ≈ 0.0039976.

300 * 0.0039976 ≈ 1.19928.

e^1.19928 ≈ 3.305.

So that seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (1.004)^300 more accurately.

Using a calculator, (1.004)^300 ≈ 3.305.

So, 1/(1.004)^300 ≈ 0.3025.

So, 1 - 0.3025 = 0.6975.

Divided by 0.004 gives 174.375.

So PMT = 331,333 / 174.375 ≈ 1900.12.

But none of the options match that exactly. The closest higher option is I:1995.10, but it's not close.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the FV calculation. Let me recalculate the FV again.

Using the future value of an ordinary annuity formula:

FV = 1000 * [ ( (1 + 0.015)^120 - 1 ) / 0.015 ]

We have (1.015)^120 ≈ 5.970.

So, (5.970 -1) = 4.970.

4.970 / 0.015 ≈ 331.333.

So FV ≈ 1000 * 331.333 ≈ $331,333.

Now, perhaps I should use the exact value of (1.004)^300.

Using a calculator, (1.004)^300 = e^(300 * ln(1.004)).

ln(1.004) ≈ 0.0039976.

300 * 0.0039976 ≈ 1.19928.

e^1.19928 ≈ 3.305.

So, 1/(1.004)^300 ≈ 0.3025.

Thus, 1 - 0.3025 = 0.6975.

0.6975 / 0.004 = 174.375.

So PMT = 331,333 / 174.375 ≈ 1900.12.

But the options don't include 1900.12. The closest higher option is I:1995.10, and the next is H:2200.00, but that's way higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the FV calculation. Let me check with a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the future value using the formula for compound interest.

The future value of each quarterly contribution can be calculated individually and then summed, but that's time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the future value of an annuity due, but the contributions are made at the end of each quarter, so it's an ordinary annuity.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of (1.015)^120.

Using a calculator, (1.015)^120 ≈ 5.970.

So, FV = 1000 * (5.970 -1)/0.015 ≈ 1000 * 331.333 ≈ $331,333.

So, the PV for the annuity is $331,333.

Now, computing PMT:

PMT = 331,333 / [ (1 - (1.004)^-300 ) / 0.004 ]

We have (1.004)^-300 ≈ 0.3025.

So, 1 - 0.3025 = 0.6975.

0.6975 / 0.004 = 174.375.

PMT = 331,333 ÷ 174.375 ≈ 1900.12.

Hmm, but the options don't include this. The closest is option I: $1,995.10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the FV calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the present value of the annuity formula correctly.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the annuity is a perpetuity, but no, it's for 25 years, so it's a finite annuity.

Wait, perhaps I can check the options with the calculated PMT of approximately $1,900.12. Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I should check the options again.

Options are:

A: 2350.60

B: 1625.33

C: 1500.50

D: 1422.75

E: 1898.27

F: 1755.45

G: 2100.35

H: 2200.00

I: 1995.10

J: 1288.88

Wait, option E is 1898.27, which is close to my calculation of 1900.12. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations, and the correct PMT is approximately $1,898.27, which is option E.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the FV or the annuity factor.

Wait, let me try to compute the annuity factor more accurately.

Compute (1.004)^300 precisely.

Using a calculator, (1.004)^300 ≈ 3.305.

So, 1/(1.004)^300 ≈ 0.3025.

So, 1 - 0.3025 = 0.6975.

Divided by 0.004: 0.6975 / 0.004 = 174.375.

So, PMT = 331,333 / 174.375 ≈ 1900.12.

Hmm, but option E is 1898.27, which is very close. Perhaps due to rounding in the FV calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact FV is slightly less, leading to a slightly lower PMT.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Let me compute (1.015)^120 using a more accurate method.

Using a calculator, (1.015)^120 = e^(120 * ln(1.015)).

ln(1.015) ≈ 0.014816045.

120 * 0.014816045 = 1.7779254.

e^1.7779254 ≈ 5.90.

Wait, but perhaps more accurately, e^1.7779254 ≈ 5.90.

So, ((5.90 -1)/0.015) = 4.90 / 0.015 ≈ 326.6667.

So FV = 1000 * 326.6667 ≈ $326,666.67.

Then, PMT = 326,666.67 / 174.375 ≈ 1,873.35.

But that's not matching any options either.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should use the future value formula correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the BA II Plus financial calculator steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the present value of annuity formula with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I:1995.10, but I'm not sure how to get there.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the FV calculation. Let me try a different approach.

The future value of each $1000 contribution can be calculated as:

FV = 1000 * (1.015)^t, where t is the number of quarters remaining until the end.

So, for the first contribution, made at t=1, it will compound for 119 quarters: 1000*(1.015)^119.

The second contribution at t=2 will compound for 118 quarters: 1000*(1.015)^118.

And so on, until the last contribution at t=120, which doesn't compound anymore: 1000*(1.015)^0 = 1000.

So the total FV is the sum from t=1 to t=120 of 1000*(1.015)^(120 - t).

This is a geometric series, and the sum can be calculated as:

FV = 1000 * [ (1.015)^120 - 1 ] / [ (1.015) - 1 ]

Which is the same as the future value of an ordinary annuity formula.

So, FV = 1000 * [ (1.015)^120 -1 ] / 0.015.

As before, if (1.015)^120 ≈ 5.970, then:

FV ≈ 1000 * (5.970 -1)/0.015 ≈ 1000 * 331.333 ≈ $331,333.

Now, for the annuity payout:

PV = $331,333.

r = 0.004.

n = 300.

Compute (1.004)^300.

Again, using a calculator, (1.004)^300 ≈ 3.305.

So, 1/(1.004)^300 ≈ 0.3025.

So, 1 - 0.3025 = 0.6975.

0.6975 / 0.004 = 174.375.

PMT = 331,333 / 174.375 ≈ 1900.12.

Since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I:1995.10.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option I is $1,995.10, which is higher than my calculation. Perhaps I made a mistake in the FV calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the FV more accurately.

Let me compute (1.015)^120 using a calculator:

Using a calculator, 1.015^120 ≈ 5.970.

So, FV = 1000 * (5.970 -1)/0.015 ≈ 1000 * 331.333 ≈ $331,333.

Then, PMT = 331,333 / [ (1 - (1.004)^-300 ) / 0.004 ]

Compute (1.004)^300 = 3.305.

So, PMT ≈ 331,333 / ( (1 - 0.3025)/0.004 ) = 331,333 / (0.6975 / 0.004) = 331,333 / 174.375 ≈ 1900.12.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option I:1995.10.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the FV calculation, perhaps the rate during the savings phase is 6% compounded quarterly, so r=0.06/4=0.015, n=120.

But perhaps the FV is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the future value of an annuity due, but the contributions are made at the end of each quarter, so it's an ordinary annuity.

Wait, perhaps I can try to compute the FV using the future value factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is approximately $1,900, but since it's not an option, perhaps the closest is option I:1995.10.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the annuity calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the present value factor more accurately.

Compute (1.004)^300 precisely.

Using a calculator, (1.004)^300 ≈ 3.305.

So, 1/(1.004)^300 ≈ 0.3025.

Then, 1 - 0.3025 = 0.6975.

0.6975 / 0.004 = 174.375.

PMT = 331,333 / 174.375 ≈ 1900.12.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is $1,900.12, but it's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial FV calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I:1995.10.

Wait, perhaps I should check the present value of the annuity.

If PMT is $1,995.10, then the present value would be:

PV = 1995.10 * [ (1 - (1.004)^-300 ) / 0.004 ]

Compute this:

(1.004)^-300 ≈ 0.3025.

1 - 0.3025 = 0.6975.

0.6975 / 0.004 = 174.375.

So, PV = 1995.10 * 174.375 ≈ 1995.10 * 174.375.

Let me compute that:

2000 * 174.375 = 348,750.

Subtract 4.9 * 174.375 ≈ 856.40625.

So, 348,750 - 856.40625 ≈ 347,893.59.

But our FV is $331,333, which is less than 347,893.59, so that can't be right.

So, perhaps option I is too high.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E:1898.27.

Let me compute the PV for PMT=1898.27:

PV = 1898.27 * 174.375 ≈ ?

Compute 1898.27 * 174.375.

Let me break it down:

1898.27 * 100 = 189,827

1898.27 * 70 = 132,878.9

1898.27 * 4.375 = ?

1898.27 * 4 = 7,593.08

1898.27 * 0.375 = 711.80625

So, 7,593.08 + 711.80625 ≈ 8,304.88625

Now, total PV ≈ 189,827 + 132,878.9 + 8,304.88625 ≈ 330, 189,827 + 132,878.9 = 322,705.9 + 8,304.88625 ≈ 331,010.786.

Which is close to our FV of $331,333.

So, PMT ≈ $1,898.27, which is option E.

Therefore, the correct answer is E:1898.27.
</think>

To determine Aisha's monthly retirement annuity payout, we first calculate the future value (FV) of her savings during the 30-year accumulation phase. She saves $1,000 quarterly at a 6% annual interest rate compounded quarterly. Using the future value of an ordinary annuity formula:

\[
FV = PMT \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}
\]

Where:
- \( PMT = 1000 \)
- \( r = 0.015 \) (quarterly interest rate)
- \( n = 120 \) (number of quarters)

\[
FV = 1000 \times \frac{(1.015)^{120} - 1}{0.015} \approx 1000 \times 331.333 \approx 331,333
\]

After 30 years, the account balance is approximately $331,333. During the 25-year payout phase, this amount earns 4.8% annual interest compounded monthly. The monthly interest rate is:

\[
r = \frac{0.048}{12} = 0.004
\]

The number of monthly payments is:

\[
n = 25 \times 12 = 300
\]

Using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula to calculate the monthly payout (\( PMT \)):

\[
PV = PMT \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}
\]

Rearranging for \( PMT \):

\[
PMT = \frac{PV}{\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
PMT = \frac{331,333}{\frac{1 - (1.004)^{-300}}{0.004}} \approx \frac{331,333}{174.375} \approx 1900.12
\]

However, since $1900.12 is not an option, the closest available option is **E: 1898.27**, which aligns closely with the calculated value when considering rounding and slight approximations in the calculations.

**Answer: E**
