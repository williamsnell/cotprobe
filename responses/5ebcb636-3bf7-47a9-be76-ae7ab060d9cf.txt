Okay, so I have this genetics problem here, and I need to figure out the number of individuals with M, MN, and N blood types based on the given gene frequencies. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem states that in a population of 610 individuals, the gene frequencies of the L^M and L^N alleles are 0.62 and 0.38, respectively. Wait, wait, I think I might be mixing up the notation here. Oh right, in blood types, the alleles are usually denoted as L^M and L^N, but sometimes it's also written as LM and LN. Either way, the frequencies are given as p = 0.62 for L^M and q = 0.38 for L^N.

I remember that in a population, the sum of allele frequencies should equal 1. Let me check: 0.62 + 0.38 equals exactly 1, so that's good. No other alleles are mentioned, so we can assume this is a two-allele system (codominant, I think, since blood types can be M, MN, or N).

Wait, no, actually, blood types are typically determined by the ABO system, but this question seems to be about the Lewis blood group system, which is a bit different. The Lewis system has alleles L^M, L^N, and L^m. But in this problem, only L^M and L^N are mentioned, so maybe L^m is not present here. Or perhaps it's a simplified version where the alleles are L^M and L^N, with L^M being dominant or codominant.

Wait, in the Lewis system, the L^M allele is codominant with L^N. So, the possible genotypes would be L^M L^M (MM), L^M L^N (MN), and L^N L^N (NN). The blood types would be M for MM, MN for MN genotype, and N for NN.

So the frequencies of the genotypes can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The frequencies are p^2, 2pq, and q^2, where p is the frequency of L^M and q is the frequency of L^N.

Let me write that down:

- Frequency of MM (L^M L^M) = p² = (0.62)²
- Frequency of MN (L^M L^N) = 2pq = 2 * 0.62 * 0.38
- Frequency of NN (L^N L^N) = q² = (0.38)²

Calculating each:

First, p squared: 0.62 * 0.62. Let me compute that. 0.6 *0.6 is 0.36, 0.02 *0.6 is 0.012, so adding up correctly, 0.62 * 0.62 equals 0.3844.

Then 2pq: 2 * 0.62 * 0.38. Let's compute 0.62 * 0.38 first. 0.6 *0.3 is 0.18, 0.6 *0.08 is 0.048, 0.02 *0.3 is 0.006, and 0.02 *0.08 is 0.0016. Wait, that's probably a more complicated way. Alternatively, 0.62 * 0.38 can be calculated as (0.6 + 0.02) * (0.3 + 0.08) = 0.6*0.3 + 0.6*0.08 + 0.02*0.3 + 0.02*0.08 = 0.18 + 0.048 + 0.006 + 0.0016 = 0.2356. So 2 * 0.2356 is 0.4712.

Lastly, q squared: 0.38 * 0.38. Let me compute that. 0.3 *0.3 is 0.09, 0.08 *0.3 is 0.024, 0.3 *0.08 is another 0.024, and 0.08 *0.08 is 0.0064. Wait, no, that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, 0.38^2 = (0.4 - 0.02)^2 = 0.16 - 2*0.4*0.02 + 0.0004 = 0.16 -0.016 + 0.0004 = 0.1444. So q² is 0.1444.

Now, let's sum these up to make sure: 0.3844 + 0.4712 = 0.8556, plus 0.1444 equals exactly 1. So that's correct.

Now, the total population is 610 individuals. To find the number of each genotype (and thus blood type), multiply each frequency by the total population.

Calculating each:

- MM (M type) individuals: 0.3844 * 610. Let me compute this. 0.38 * 610 is 231.8, and 0.0044 *610 is about 2.684, so adding 231.8 + 2.684 gives approximately 234.484. So round to the nearest whole number, which would be 234. Wait, but looking at the options, maybe I should check more accurately.

Alternatively, 0.3844 * 610:

Compute 0.3844 * 600 = 230.64, and 0.3844 *10 = 3.844. So total is 230.64 + 3.844 = 234.484. So approximately 234.484, which is about 234 people. But let's check the options to see if any have 234 M. Looking at the options:

Option A: 238 M → higher than 234. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation, or perhaps the options are rounded differently.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me compute 0.3844 * 610.

Alternatively, 610 * 0.3844:

Compute 610 * 0.3 = 183

610 * 0.08 = 48.8 → 183 + 48.8 = 231.8

610 * 0.004 = 2.44 → 231.8 + 2.44 = 234.24

610 * 0.0004 = 0.244 → 234.24 + 0.244 = 234.484, which is about 234.48, so 234 when rounded down, but options might round to the nearest whole number. So perhaps 234 is correct, but looking at the options, none of the options have 234. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 238 M, 292 MN, 80 N → 238 +292 is 530, plus 80 is 610. So total correct. But the M is 238, which is higher than my calculation.

Option B: 230 M, 295 MN, 85 N → 230+295=525 +85=610. M is 230, which is lower than my 234.

Option H: 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N → 235+287=522 +88=610. M is 235, which is close.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recalculate p^2.

p = 0.62 → p² = 0.62 * 0.62.

0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36

0.6 * 0.02 = 0.012

0.02 * 0.6 = 0.012

0.02 * 0.02 = 0.0004

Adding up the cross terms: 0.36 + (0.012 + 0.012) + 0.0004 = 0.36 + 0.024 + 0.0004 = 0.3844. So that's correct.

So 0.3844 *610=234.484.

Wait, but none of the options have exactly 234. Let me check the other calculations.

Next, MN frequency is 0.4712. So 0.4712 *610.

Compute 0.47 *610 = 286.7

0.0012 *610 = 0.732 → 286.7 +0.732=287.432. So approximately 287.43, which is about 287 individuals. But looking at the options, option H has 287 MN, which would fit this.

Then NN is 0.1444 *610.

0.14 *610=85.4

0.0044 *610=2.684 → 85.4 +2.684=88.084. So about 88 individuals.

So putting it together, M=234, MN=287, N=88. Now looking at the options, option H is 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N. That's very close. Perhaps the slight discrepancy is due to rounding during the calculation steps.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the actual p and q sum to 1, but perhaps I should carry more decimal places to be precise.

Wait, let me check more accurately:

p = 0.62 → p² = 0.62 * 0.62.

I'll compute 0.62 *0.62:

62 *62 = 3844. So 0.62^2=0.3844.

2pq = 2 *0.62 *0.38.

Compute 0.62 *0.38: 0.2356. Multiply by 2: 0.4712.

q² = 0.38^2 = 0.1444.

So, the exact frequencies are 0.3844, 0.4712, 0.1444.

Now, for 610 individuals:

M: 0.3844 *610 = ?

Let me compute 3844 *610, then adjust for the decimal.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute each exactly:

0.3844 *610 = ?

Compute step by step:

610 * 0.3 = 183

610 * 0.08 = 48.8 → sum is 231.8

610 * 0.004 = 2.44 → sum is 234.24

610 * 0.0004 = 0.244 → sum is 234.484.

So, 234.484 individuals, which is approximately 234 when rounded down, but perhaps the options have rounded it differently. Looking at option H, it's 235 M, which is just one more than 234.484. Maybe the calculation expects us to round to the nearest whole number, so 234.484 rounds to 234, but perhaps the option has 235 due to a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial approach.

Wait another thought: perhaps the question is using the L^M and L^N as dominant and recessive, but I think in the Lewis system, L^M is codominant with L^N. So the genotypes would be LM LM (M), LM LN (MN), and LN LN (N). Therefore, the frequencies are p², 2pq, q², as I used earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering L^M as dominant over L^N, so the possible phenotypes would be M (homozygous and heterozygous) and N (homozygous). But that would change the calculation.

Wait, no, in the Lewis system, I believe L^M and L^N are codominant, so the presence of both alleles leads to the MN phenotype. So the standard Hardy-Weinberg applies.

So, perhaps the correct numbers are:

M: ~234

MN: ~287

N: ~88

Looking back at the options, option H is 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N. The sum is 235 +287=522 +88=610, which matches.

But wait, 234.484 is approximately 234.5, which would round to 235 when rounded to the nearest whole number. So perhaps the correct answer is option H.

Wait, but let me double-check the MN calculation.

MN is 0.4712 *610 = ?

0.4712 *600 = 282.72

0.4712 *10 =4.712 → total 287.432, which is 287.432, so 287 when rounded down, or 287 when rounded to the nearest.

Similarly, N is 0.1444 *610 = ?

0.1444 *600 =86.64

0.1444 *10=1.444 → total 88.084 → 88 when rounded.

So the closest option would be 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N, which is option H.

Wait, but option H is 235,287,88. That's exactly what I calculated when rounding each to the nearest whole number.

Looking at the options, that's option H: 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N.

So the correct answer should be option H.
</think>

To determine the number of individuals with M, MN, and N blood types, we use the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The allele frequencies are given as \( p = 0.62 \) for \( L^M \) and \( q = 0.38 \) for \( L^N \). The genotype frequencies are calculated as:

- \( p^2 \) for \( L^M L^M \) (M type),
- \( 2pq \) for \( L^M L^N \) (MN type),
- \( q^2 \) for \( L^N L^N \) (N type).

### Calculations:
1. **M type (\( p^2 \)):**
   \[
   p^2 = (0.62)^2 = 0.3844
   \]
   Multiply by the population (610):
   \[
   0.3844 \times 610 = 234.484 \approx 234
   \]

2. **MN type (\( 2pq \)):**
   \[
   2pq = 2 \times 0.62 \times 0.38 = 0.4712
   \]
   Multiply by the population (610):
   \[
   0.4712 \times 610 = 287.432 \approx 287
   \]

3. **N type (\( q^2 \)):**
   \[
   q^2 = (0.38)^2 = 0.1444
   \]
   Multiply by the population (610):
   \[
   0.1444 \times 610 = 88.084 \approx 88
   \]

### Verification:
The calculated values are approximately \( 234 \) M, \( 287 \) MN, and \( 88 \) N. Rounding \( 234.484 \) to the nearest whole number gives \( 235 \), which matches option H. The total individuals sum to \( 610 \), confirming the calculations are correct.

### Final Answer:
H: 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N

H
