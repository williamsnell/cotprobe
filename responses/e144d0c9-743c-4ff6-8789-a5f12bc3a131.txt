Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this question about proactive interference. Let me start by recalling what proactive interference is. From what I remember, proactive interference happens when previously learned information interferes with the recall of newly learned information. So, if you learn something first, and then try to learn something else, the first list might make it harder to remember the second one because the brain gets confused or mixes them up.

The question gives me four lists: 1, 2, 3, 4. The order of learning is list 1 first, then list 2, and so on. The question is asking which list(s) would cause proactive interference for remembering list 2.

Proactive interference occurs when the first learned material (the earlier list) interferes with the later one. So, in this case, list 1 would interfere with list 2 because list 1 was learned before list 2. That makes sense because the earlier information is still in the memory, and when trying to recall the later list, you might mix up the two.

Wait, but the question is about which lists cause interference for list 2. So, any list learned before list 2 could interfere. Since list 1 is learned first, it's definitely a source of proactive interference for list 2. What about the other lists? List 3 and 4 are learned after list 2, so they wouldn't cause proactive interference for list 2 because they come later. Proactive interference is about earlier information affecting later information, not the other way around.

So, only list 1 would cause proactive interference for list 2. Let me check the options. Option B says list 1 only. That seems right. But wait, the options also include others. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything.

Proactive interference is specifically about the prior learning affecting the later one. So, any list learned before list 2 would interfere. Since only list 1 is before list 2, that's the only one. Lists 3 and 4 come after, so they don't interfere with list 2 in terms of proactive interference.

So the answer should be B: list 1 only.

The correct answer is B: list 1 only, because proactive interference occurs when earlier learned information (list 1) interferes with the recall of later information (list 2). Lists 3 and 4 are learned after list 2 and thus do not cause proactive interference.

Answer: B
