Okay, so I have this question about investments and I need to figure out what the investment is worth. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says: An investment will pay out $10 per annum forever. What is that investment worth if the market discount rate is 5%? The options are from A to J, with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, I remember that when an investment pays a fixed amount every year indefinitely, it's called a perpetuity. Oh right, the formula for the present value of a perpetuity is the annual payment divided by the discount rate. So the formula should be PV = C / r, where C is the annual cash flow and r is the discount rate.

In this case, C is $10, and the discount rate r is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal. So plugging the numbers in: PV = 10 / 0.05. Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 0.05 is the same as 10 multiplied by 20, which equals $200. 

Wait, let me double-check that. 0.05 is 5%, so 1/0.05 is 20. So yes, 10 times 20 is 200. So the present value should be $200.

Looking at the options, J is $200. So the answer should be J.

The investment is a perpetuity paying $10 annually. Using the formula PV = C / r, where C = $10 and r = 5% (0.05), we calculate PV = $200. 

Answer: J
