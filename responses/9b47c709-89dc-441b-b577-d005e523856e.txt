Okay, so I've got this accounting question here about contingent liabilities, and I need to figure out the correct amount Dari Inc. should accrue on its balance sheet. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says Dari Inc. guaranteed the debt of a related party. In December, they found out there's a probable payment between $150,000 and $200,000 within the next six months. Importantly, no amount within that range is more likely than another. So, they're asking what contingent liability Dari should record.

First, I remember that contingent liabilities are potential obligations that depend on future events. The key here is whether the liability is probable and can be estimated. If it's probable, the company has to accrue the liability, and if it's possible but not probable, they might just disclose it in the notes.

In this case, the problem states it's probable they'll have to pay. So, they do need to recognize a liability. Now, the next part is figuring out the amount. The range is from $150k to $200k, and no one amount is more likely. So, it's a range without a midpoint that's more probable.

I think when there's a range and no specific point is more likely, the best practice is to use the average of the range. Let me check that. The average of 150k and 200k is (150,000 + 200,000)/2 = 175,000. So, that would be $175,000.

Looking at the options, option H is $175,000. So that should be the right answer. But wait, sometimes I've heard about using the lower end or upper end, but in cases without a more probable amount, the average is the standard approach.

To make sure, I recall that according to accounting standards like ASC 450, when a range is established and no amount within the range is more likely, the company should use the mean or average. So yes, 175k makes sense here.

So, the correct answer should be H: $175,000.

The correct answer is H: $175,000.
