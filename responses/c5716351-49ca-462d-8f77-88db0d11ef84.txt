Okay, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Shodi earned 389 points in the first level of her video game. Then she earned an additional 116 points in the bonus round. The question is asking how many points in total she earned in both the first level and the bonus round. The options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 205 up to 600.

Alright, so the problem is about adding two numbers together. I think I can handle this, but let me break it down step by step to make sure I don't make any mistakes.

First, I'll note down the two numbers she earned: 389 points from the first level and 116 points from the bonus. So, I need to add 389 and 116 together to find the total points.

Let me write this out as a simple addition problem:

389
+116
------
?

I'll start by adding the units place. 9 (from 389) plus 6 (from 116) equals 15. Hmm, that's more than 10, so I'll carry over the 1 to the tens place.

Next, the tens place: 8 (from 389) plus 1 (from 116) plus the carried over 1 makes 10. Again, that's more than 10, so I'll carry over another 1 to the hundreds place.

Now, the hundreds place: 3 (from 389) plus 1 (from 116) plus the carried over 1 equals 5. So, putting it all together, the total would be 505.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when adding, especially with carrying over, it's easy to miscount.

Alternatively, I could add 389 and 116 in another way to verify. Let's see, 389 plus 100 is 489, and then plus 16 would be 505. Yep, that matches what I got before.

Looking at the options provided, option J is 505. So that must be the correct answer.

I don't think I've made any mistakes here. The addition seems straightforward, and I double-checked it by breaking it down differently. So I'm confident that J is the right choice.

The total points Shodi earned is calculated by adding 389 and 116, which equals 505. 

Answer: J
