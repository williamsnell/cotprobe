Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the frequency of AABBCC individuals resulting from a mating between two AaBbCc parents. Hmm, I think I remember that when you have multiple genes involved, each gene is treated independently during meiosis, right? So each gene's alleles assort themselves independently. But wait, how does that work when there are three genes instead of just one?

Each parent is AaBbCc. So for each gene, the parent can produce gametes. Let's break it down gene by gene.

Starting with the A gene. The parent is Aa, so when they produce gametes, they can give either A or a. The probability of each is 50%, so 1/2 for A and 1/2 for a.

Similarly, for the B gene: Bb. So gametes can be B or b, each with a 50% chance.

And the C gene: Cc. Gametes can be C or c, each at 50%.

Since all three genes are independent, the gametes are combinations of these. So each gamete has one allele for each gene. The total number of possible gametes is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8, but I might not need to list them all.

Now, the question is about the offspring being AABBCC. That means the offspring must have AA for the first gene, BB for the second, and CC for the third.

Let's think about each gene separately again. For the A gene, the parent can give A or a. To get AA in the offspring, both parents must contribute an A. So each parent has to give an A. The probability that one parent gives A is 1/2, and the same for the other parent. So the chance for AA is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Similarly, for BB: each parent must give B. The chance each parent gives B is 1/2, so BB occurs with probability 1/4.

Same logic applies to CC. Each parent must give C, so 1/2 each, so 1/4 for CC.

Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is the product of each individual probability. So 1/4 (for AA) * 1/4 (for BB) * 1/4 (for CC) = (1/4)^3 = 1/64.

Wait, but let me double-check. Each gene is independent, so the multiplication applies. So for each gene, the chance is 1/4, and since there are three, multiply them together. Yeah, 1/4 * 1/4 * 1/4 is 1/64. So the probability is 1/64.

Looking at the options, option F is 1/64. So the answer should be F.

The frequency of AABBCC individuals resulting from the mating of two AaBbCc individuals is calculated by considering each gene independently. For each gene, the probability of the offspring inheriting the homozygous dominant allele (AA, BB, or CC) is 1/4. Since the genes assort independently, the combined probability is (1/4)^3 = 1/64.
