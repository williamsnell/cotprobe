Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The base of a solid is the region bounded by the curve x² = 4y and the line y = 2. Each plane section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square. I need to find the volume of this solid, and there are multiple-choice options given.

Hmm, alright. Let's break this down. First, I should visualize the base region. The curve x² = 4y is a parabola that opens upwards. To get a better idea, maybe I should sketch it or at least think about its shape.

When y = 0, x² = 0, so it passes through the origin. When y increases, x becomes larger. Since it's x squared, it's symmetric about the y-axis. So, for each y, there are two x-values: positive and negative. The line y = 2 is a horizontal line that will intersect the parabola at some points.

Let me find where the parabola and the line intersect. Setting y = 2 in x² = 4y gives x² = 8, so x = ±√8, which simplifies to ±2√2. So the points of intersection are at (√8, 2) and (-√8, 2). The region bounded by these curves is the area under the parabola from y=0 up to y=2.

Now, the solid has each plane section perpendicular to the y-axis being a square. That means if I take a slice perpendicular to the y-axis at any point y, I get a square. The side length of each square must relate to the dimensions of the base at that y.

Wait, so for each y, the cross-section is a square. The side of the square must be the length of the region in the x-direction at that y. Since the base is bounded by x² =4y, solving for x gives x = ±2√y. So at any height y, the horizontal extent is from -2√y to +2√y, meaning the length in the x-direction is 4√y (since from negative to positive is twice 2√y).

But wait, the cross-section is a square perpendicular to the y-axis. Since the slices are perpendicular to the y-axis, each slice is at a particular y. The side of the square must be the width in the x-direction at that y. Because the base is the region between the parabola and y=2, so at each y, the horizontal width is from x=-2√y to x=2√y, which is a length of 4√y.

But wait, if the cross-section is a square, then each side of the square is equal in length. But if the plane is perpendicular to the y-axis, the cross-section is a square. So, for each y, the side length of the square is the width in the x-direction, which is 4√y. But wait, that can't be right because if the square's side is 4√y, then the area would be (4√y)² = 16y. But wait, that would make the volume the integral of 16y dy from y=0 to y=2.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm confusing the axes here. Since the cross-section is perpendicular to the y-axis, each slice is taken along the y-axis, so the cross-section is in the x-z plane, perhaps. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the cross-sectional area as a function of y.

Wait, the base is in the x-y plane, right? So each cross-section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square whose side is the length in the x-direction at that y. So for each y, the cross-sectional area would be (side length)^2, where the side length is the length from the left boundary to the right boundary in the x-direction at that y.

So, for the parabola x²=4y, solving for x gives x = ±2√y. So the width at any y is from -2√y to 2√y, which is a total width of 4√y. Since each cross-section is a square, the area at each y is (4√y)^2, which is 16y.

Wait, but that's not correct because if the side length is 4√y, then the area would be (4√y)^2 = 16y. So the volume would be the integral from y=0 to y=2 of 16y dy.

Wait, let me compute that integral. The integral of 16y dy is 8y². Evaluating from 0 to 2 gives 8*(2)^2 - 8*(0)^2 = 8*4 = 32. So the volume would be 32, which is option B.

But wait, that seems a bit straightforward. Let me check if I'm interpreting the cross-section correctly. The problem says each plane section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square. So, for each y, the cross-section is a square with side length equal to the width in the x-direction at that y, which is 4√y. So the area is (4√y)^2 = 16y. Integrating that from y=0 to y=2 gives the volume.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the side length. Maybe the side length isn't 4√y but something else. Let me think again.

Wait, the base is bounded by x²=4y and y=2. So, for a given y between 0 and 2, the x-values range from -2√y to +2√y. So the length of the base in the x-direction is 4√y. Now, if the cross-section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square, then the side of the square would be this length, 4√y. So the area of the cross-section is (4√y)^2 = 16y.

So, integrating this area from y=0 to y=2:

Volume = ∫ (from y=0 to y=2) 16y dy
= 16 * ∫ y dy from 0 to 2
= 16 * [ (1/2) y² ] from 0 to 2
= 16 * ( (1/2)(2)^2 - 0 )
= 16 * ( (1/2)*4 )
= 16 * 2
= 32

So the volume is 32, which is option B.

Wait a second, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have a cross-section, the side might not be along the x-axis. Let me make sure. If the cross-section is a square perpendicular to the y-axis, then the square's sides are aligned with the x and z axes, perhaps. But in this case, since the base is in the x-y plane, the cross-sections are squares extending along the z-axis, with side length determined by the x-extent at each y.

So, the area is indeed (4√y)^2, leading to the volume being 32.

Alternatively, maybe I should visualize it as the solid being built by squares whose sides are the horizontal width at each y. So, if the width is 4√y, then the square's area is 16y, and the integral from 0 to 2 is 32.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: perhaps the side of the square is the distance from the origin to the curve in x-direction at each y, so 2√y, making the side length 2√y. Then the area would be (2√y)^2 = 4y, leading to the integral from 0 to 2 being 4y dy, which would be 2y² evaluated from 0 to 2, giving 8. That would be option A:8, but that seems too small. But maybe I'm confusing the width.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the width is from -2√y to 2√y, which is 4√y. So the side length must be 4√y, not 2√y. Because each square's side is the full width of the base at that y.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The initial calculation seems correct: the area is 16y, integral is 32, so the answer is B:32.
</think>

The base of the solid is bounded by the parabola \( x^2 = 4y \) and the line \( y = 2 \). Each cross-section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square. At a given \( y \), the horizontal width is \( 4\sqrt{y} \), making the area of each square \( (4\sqrt{y})^2 = 16y \). Integrating this area from \( y = 0 \) to \( y = 2 \) gives the volume:

\[
\int_0^2 16y \, dy = 16 \left[ \frac{y^2}{2} \right]_0^2 = 16 \cdot 2 = 32.
\]
