Question:

What does it mean if the heritability index for a particular trait ishigh?

Options:

A: The trait will be the same across all individuals regardless of their environment
B: 90% of the variance found in the scores in the population are attributable to environmental factors
C: The trait is entirely determined by environmental factors and has no genetic basis
D: Heritability index indicates that the trait cannot be passed down from generation to generation
E: Heritability index has no connection with genetic factors
F: 70% of the variance found in the scores in the population are attributable to genetic factors
G: The trait is not influenced by any external factors and is solely determined by genetics
H: Heritability index indicates the degree of modifiability of the trait
I: 50% of the variance found in the scores in the population is due to genetic factors and the other 50% to environmental factors
J: The heritability index for the trait is a fixed value and does not vary across populations

Okay, so I've got this question about heritability indexes, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is asking what a high heritability index for a trait means. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that heritability refers to how much of the variation in a trait within a population is due to genetic differences. So, a high heritability index would mean that most of the variation in that trait is genetic. But wait, I should be careful here because sometimes people get confused between heritability and the idea that a trait is entirely genetic.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says the trait will be the same across all individuals regardless of environment. That doesn't sound right because even if a trait is highly heritable, environment can still play a role. For example, height is quite heritable, but nutrition and environment can affect how tall someone grows.

Option B claims 90% of the variance is due to environment. No, that's the opposite of high heritability. High heritability would mean more variance is genetic, so B is probably wrong.

Option C says the trait is entirely determined by environment and has no genetic basis. That's definitely not correct because high heritability implies a strong genetic component.

Option D states the heritability index means the trait can't be passed down. Wait, heritability is about genetic transmission, so a high index would mean it can be passed down more. So D is incorrect.

Option E says heritability has no connection with genetics. That's wrong because heritability is all about genetics.

Option F says 70% of variance is genetic. Hmm, that's a high heritability but not the maximum. I'm not sure if this is the best answer because the question is about a high heritability index, which typically refers to a larger percentage than 70%, maybe closer to 80-90%.

Option G suggests the trait is not influenced by external factors. No, because heritability is about the proportion of variance due to genetics, not the absence of environmental influence. Even with high heritability, environment still plays some role.

Option H says heritability index indicates the degree of modifiability. Modifiability would relate to how much the environment can change the trait, which is the opposite of high heritability. So H is probably incorrect.

Option I states 50% genetic and 50% environmental. That's moderate heritability, not high, so I is not the answer.

Option J claims the heritability is a fixed value across populations. I think heritability can vary based on the population and environment, so J is wrong.

Wait, so going back, the question is about a high heritability index. So, high heritability means a large proportion of variance is genetic. Option F says 70%, which is high, but sometimes people consider heritability as being high when it's above 50%. However, the options don't have a 90% option except B, which is about environment. But B is wrong because high heritability would mean more genetics, not environment.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. If the heritability index is high, it means a higher percentage of variance is due to genetics. So looking at the options again, F is 70% genetic, which is high, but is it the best answer? Or is there a better option?

Wait, the options don't have a 90% one, but I think the correct understanding is that a high heritability index indicates that a large proportion of the variance is genetic. So, if the heritability is high, like 70-80%, then the correct answer would be F. But wait, another thought: sometimes heritability is reported as the proportion of variance due to genetics, so a high index (like 0.8) would mean 80% genetics. So F is 70%, which is high but perhaps not the maximum. But the options don't have a higher number, so F is the best fit among the options given.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Heritability is the proportion of observed differences in a trait among individuals that can be attributed to genetic differences. So if the heritability index is high, say 0.8, that means 80% of the variance is genetic. So among the options, F says 70% is genetic, which is high but perhaps not the maximum. But the question is about a high index, so maybe the correct answer is that a high heritability index indicates that a large proportion, but not all, is genetic. So F is correct because it's 70%, which is high.

Wait, but I recall that in some cases, high heritability is considered to be above 50%, so 70% would be high. Alternatively, heritability can be up to 100%, but that's rare. So the options don't have a higher number, so F is the best choice.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option F is 70% genetic. So if the heritability index is high, that would mean that a larger portion is genetic. So F is the correct answer.

The heritability index reflects the proportion of variance in a trait within a population that is attributable to genetic differences. A high heritability index indicates that a significant portion of the variation in the trait is due to genetic factors. Among the options provided, option F states that 70% of the variance is attributable to genetic factors, which aligns with the understanding of a high heritability index. Other options either misrepresent the concept or provide incorrect proportions.

Answer: F
