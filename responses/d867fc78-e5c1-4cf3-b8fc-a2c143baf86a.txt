Okay, so I have this question about time series analysis, specifically about an MA(1) model. Hmm, I remember that MA stands for Moving Average, and the number 1 means it's of order 1. The question says it's an MA(1) with zero mean and a moving average coefficient of 0.4. I need to find the autocovariance at lag 1.

Wait, let me think about what an MA(1) model looks like. The general form is something like X_t = ε_t + θε_{t-1}, right? Oh wait, θ is the moving average coefficient here, which is 0.4 in this case. So θ = 0.4.

Autocovariance... I recall that for an MA(q) model, the autocovariance function (ACVF) is non-zero only up to lag q. Since this is MA(1), the autocovariance at lag 1 should be non-zero, and beyond that, it's zero. But wait, I need to calculate it specifically.

The formula for the autocovariance at lag k for an MA(q) model is a bit tricky. For k = 0, it's just the variance of the series, which is (1 + θ^2)σ^2, where σ^2 is the variance of the white noise ε_t. But since the mean is zero, that's straightforward.

For lag 1, the autocovariance γ(1) should involve the product of the coefficients. In the case of MA(1), the autocovariance at lag 1 is θ times the variance of ε. Let me see... Wait, the general formula for γ(k) for MA(q) is that for |k| ≤ q, γ(k) = θ_k * σ^2, where θ_k is the coefficient at lag k. But wait, no, I think that's for AR models. Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. For MA(1), the autocovariance γ(1) is θ * σ^2. Because the model is X_t = ε_t + θ ε_{t-1}. So the covariance between X_t and X_{t-1} would be Cov(X_t, X_{t-1}) = Cov(ε_t + θ ε_{t-1}, ε_{t-1} + θ ε_{t-2}).

Let me compute that. Expanding the covariance: Cov(ε_t, ε_{t-1}) + θ Cov(ε_t, ε_{t-2}) + θ Cov(ε_{t-1}, ε_{t-1}) + θ^2 Cov(ε_{t-1}, ε_{t-2}).

But since ε is white noise, the covariance between ε_t and ε_{t-1} is zero, same for ε_t and ε_{t-2}, and ε_{t-1} and ε_{t-2} are also zero. The only non-zero term is Cov(ε_{t-1}, ε_{t-1}) which is σ^2. So γ(1) = θ * σ^2.

Wait, but the question is about the autocovariance, and in the options, I don't see σ^2 mentioned. Oh, wait, perhaps they assume that the variance σ^2 is 1? Because sometimes in these problems, they normalize things. Let me think: if σ^2 is 1, then γ(1) would be θ, which is 0.4. But wait, I'm not sure if the variance is given or if it's supposed to be calculated considering the series variance.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the autocorrelation function instead. The autocorrelation at lag 1 for an MA(1) is θ / (1 + θ^2). Oh wait, that's the autocorrelation, not the autocovariance. So for autocorrelation, it's 0.4 / (1 + 0.4^2) = 0.4 / 1.16 ≈ 0.3448. That's about 0.34. But that's the autocorrelation, not the autocovariance.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:

Autocovariance γ(k) is the covariance between X_t and X_{t-k}.

For an MA(1) model, X_t = ε_t + θ ε_{t-1}.

So, X_{t-1} = ε_{t-1} + θ ε_{t-2}.

The covariance γ(1) is Cov(X_t, X_{t-1}) = Cov(ε_t + θ ε_{t-1}, ε_{t-1} + θ ε_{t-2}).

As I calculated earlier, the only non-zero term is when you have ε_{t-1} with itself, so θ * Var(ε_{t-1}) = θ σ^2.

So γ(1) = θ σ^2.

But the problem doesn't specify the variance of the disturbance ε. It just says it's an MA(1) with zero mean and moving average coefficient 0.4. So perhaps σ^2 is 1 by default? Because in many cases, white noise is assumed to have unit variance unless stated otherwise.

If σ^2 = 1, then γ(1) = 0.4 * 1 = 0.4. So the answer would be F: 0.4.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the autocovariance at lag 1 is θ times the variance, so if θ is 0.4 and the variance is 1, then yes, 0.4.

Looking at the options, F is 0.4. But wait, let me check another approach. The variance of the MA(1) process is Var(X_t) = Var(ε_t) + θ^2 Var(ε_{t-1}) = σ^2 (1 + θ^2). So if σ^2 is 1, Var(X_t) is 1 + 0.16 = 1.16.

But the autocovariance at lag 1 is Cov(X_t, X_{t-1}) = θ σ^2 = 0.4. So yes, 0.4.

Wait, but I recall that the autocorrelation function (ACF) for MA(1) at lag 1 is θ/(1 + θ^2). So if θ is 0.4, then ACF is 0.4/(1.16) ≈ 0.3448. But that's the correlation, not the covariance.

So the question is about autocovariance, which is θ σ^2. If σ^2 is 1, then it's 0.4.

Looking at the options, F is 0.4, which would be the correct answer. But wait, another option is E: 0.2. How does that come in?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again.

The model is X_t = ε_t + θ ε_{t-1}, θ = 0.4.

Compute γ(1) = E[X_t X_{t-1}] - E[X_t] E[X_{t-1}]. Since the mean is zero, the last term is zero.

So E[X_t X_{t-1}] = E[(ε_t + 0.4 ε_{t-1})(ε_{t-1} + 0.4 ε_{t-2})}.

Expanding this: E[ε_t ε_{t-1}] + 0.4 E[ε_t ε_{t-2}] + 0.4 E[ε_{t-1}^2] + 0.16 E[ε_{t-1} ε_{t-2}].

Each of these terms: E[ε_t ε_{t-1}] is zero because ε is white noise, same for E[ε_t ε_{t-2}], E[ε_{t-1} ε_{t-2}]. Only E[ε_{t-1}^2] is σ^2. So γ(1) = 0.4 σ^2.

If σ^2 is 1, then γ(1) = 0.4.

So the answer should be F: 0.4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought sometimes the formula for MA(q) autocovariance is that γ(k) = 0 for k>q, but for k=q, it's θ_q σ^2. So for MA(1), γ(1)=θ σ^2.

Yes, that makes sense.

So the correct answer is F: 0.4.
</think>

The question involves determining the autocovariance at lag 1 for an MA(1) series with a zero mean and a moving average coefficient of 0.4. The MA(1) model is given by \( X_t = \epsilon_t + \theta \epsilon_{t-1} \), where \( \theta = 0.4 \). The autocovariance at lag 1, \( \gamma(1) \), is calculated as the covariance between \( X_t \) and \( X_{t-1} \).

Expanding \( X_t \) and \( X_{t-1} \), we have:
\[
X_t = \epsilon_t + 0.4 \epsilon_{t-1}, \quad X_{t-1} = \epsilon_{t-1} + 0.4 \epsilon_{t-2}.
\]
The covariance \( \gamma(1) = \text{Cov}(X_t, X_{t-1}) \) is computed as:
\[
\gamma(1) = \text{Cov}(\epsilon_t + 0.4 \epsilon_{t-1}, \epsilon_{t-1} + 0.4 \epsilon_{t-2}).
\]
Since \( \epsilon \) is white noise, cross-covariances like \( \text{Cov}(\epsilon_t, \epsilon_{t-1}) \) and \( \text{Cov}(\epsilon_{t-1}, \epsilon_{t-2}) \) are zero. The only non-zero term is \( 0.4 \text{Cov}(\epsilon_{t-1}, \epsilon_{t-1}) = 0.4 \sigma^2 \), where \( \sigma^2 \) is the variance of the white noise. Assuming \( \sigma^2 = 1 \), we find \( \gamma(1) = 0.4 \).

Thus, the autocovariance at lag 1 is 0.4.
