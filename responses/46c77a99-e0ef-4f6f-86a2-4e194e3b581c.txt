Okay, so I have this question about duties corresponding to rights to goods and services. Hmm, let me think through this. The question is asking which of the options is an example of a duty that aligns with the right to goods and services.

First, I need to understand what a right to goods and services entails. From what I remember, rights to goods and services typically refer to the entitlements that individuals have to receive certain services or items provided by others, often within a societal or legal framework. So, a duty in this context would be an obligation someone has to provide those goods or services.

Looking at the options:

Option A: John's duty to return Mary's car. That seems like a specific obligation, maybe based on a loan or ownership. If Mary lent her car to John, he has a duty to return it. This sounds more like a personal obligation rather than a societal service. Maybe this is more about property rights than goods and services.

Option B: John's duty to allow Mary to pursue her goals. That's a bit vague. Allowing someone to pursue goals could be related to freedom of action, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to goods and services. It might be more about personal autonomy or non-interference.

Option C: John's duty not to harm Mary. This is about not causing harm, which is more related to the right not to be harmed. That's a duty of non-maleficence, perhaps a negative duty. I'm not sure if this is about goods and services, as it's more about not causing harm.

Option D: John's duty not to commit suicide. That's a duty towards himself, ensuring his own well-being. It doesn't seem to relate to providing goods or services to others.

Wait, maybe I need to think about this differently. Rights to goods and services could involve things like healthcare, education, transportation, etc. The duty would be for someone, like a service provider, to deliver those services.

Looking again, Option A is about returning a borrowed car, which is more about personal property. So maybe that's not the right fit. Option B, allowing Mary to pursue her goals, could be interpreted as not obstructing her, but I'm not sure if that's a goods/services duty.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The right to goods and services implies that someone has a duty to provide those. So, if Mary has a right to a service, John has a duty to provide it.

Option B says John's duty to allow Mary to pursue her goals. Maybe if Mary's goals require certain services, John's duty is to facilitate that. Alternatively, if John is in a position to provide services, he must allow her to access them.

Alternatively, perhaps Option A is more about a specific item, not a service. So, maybe the correct answer is B because it's about enabling Mary to achieve her goals, which could involve providing necessary services or goods.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The right to goods and services is about access to necessary items or services provided by others. So the duty would be to provide those. So, which option reflects that?

Option B says John's duty to allow Mary to pursue her goals. If Mary's goals require certain services, John might have a duty to support that, which could involve providing the necessary services. So that could be the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing it up with other rights. The right to education is a service, so the duty would be to provide education. But in the options, it's more about allowing someone to pursue their goals, which could involve providing the means.

Hmm, I'm still a bit confused. Maybe I should think about each option's context. Option A is about returning a borrowed item, which is a personal duty. Option B is about allowing someone to pursue goals, which could be a broader societal duty. Option C is about not harming, which is a negative duty. Option D is about self-care.

I think the correct answer is B because it's about enabling someone else's rights to pursue their goals, which could involve providing services or access. So, John's duty to allow Mary to pursue her goals would correspond to her right to access the necessary goods or services to achieve those goals.

The correct answer is **B**. John's duty to allow Mary to pursue her goals aligns with the right to goods and services, as it involves enabling access to necessary resources or opportunities.

Answer: B
