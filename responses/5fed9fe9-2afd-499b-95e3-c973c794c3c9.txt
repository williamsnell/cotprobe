Okay, so I've got this problem about a silver wire and its resistance changing with temperature. Hmm, I remember that resistance in metals increases with temperature because the electrons have a harder time moving through the atoms when they're vibrating more. But wait, I should probably think about the formula they gave me.

The problem says the wire has a resistance of 1.25 ohms at 0°C, and the temperature coefficient of resistance is 0.00375 per degree Celsius. I need to find out to what temperature the wire must be raised so that the resistance doubles. Oh right, doubling the resistance would make it 2.5 ohms because 1.25 times 2 is 2.5.

I think the formula for resistance change with temperature is something like R = R0 * (1 + α * T), where R is the resistance at temperature T, R0 is the resistance at 0°C, α is the temperature coefficient, and T is the temperature in degrees Celsius.

Wait, let me make sure I have the formula right. Oh right, yes, that's the correct formula. So plugging in the numbers, R is 2.5 ohms, R0 is 1.25 ohms, α is 0.00375, and T is what I'm solving for.

So substituting the values into the equation: 2.5 = 1.25 * (1 + 0.00375 * T). Let me simplify this step by step. First, I'll divide both sides by 1.25 to get rid of that coefficient. So 2.5 divided by 1.25 is 2. So now I have 2 = 1 + 0.00375*T.

Next, I subtract 1 from both sides to isolate the term with T. That leaves me with 1 = 0.00375*T. Now, to solve for T, I'll divide both sides by 0.00375. So T equals 1 divided by 0.00375.

Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.00375. Hmm, 0.00375 is the same as 3.75e-3. So 1 / 0.00375 equals approximately 266.666... degrees Celsius. Looking at the options, H is 266°C, which is the closest to this value. So the answer should be H.

Wait, let me just double-check my steps. Starting with R = R0*(1 + α*T). 2.5 = 1.25*(1 + 0.00375*T). Divided both sides by 1.25 gives 2 = 1 + 0.00375*T. Subtract 1: 1 = 0.00375*T. T = 1 / 0.00375 = 266.666... Yeah, that looks right. So the correct option is H: 266°C.
