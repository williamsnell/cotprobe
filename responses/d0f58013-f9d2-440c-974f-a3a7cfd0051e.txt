Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. The problem is: Find the value of the expression −25 − (−11). The options are A through J, with various numbers. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive. So, when I see −25 − (−11), I think it's like adding 11 to −25. Wait, no, maybe I should break it down more carefully. Let me write it out.

The expression is −25 minus negative 11. So, in math terms, that's −25 − (−11). I remember that subtracting a negative is adding the positive. So, it's the same as −25 + 11. Okay, that makes sense because subtracting a negative number flips the sign from minus to plus.

Now, I need to compute −25 + 11. Hmm, adding a positive number to a negative number. I think I can visualize this on a number line. Starting at −25 and moving 11 steps to the right. So, from −25, if I add 11, where do I land?

Let me count. From −25 to −14 is 11 steps because −25 + 11 equals −14. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. If I have −25 and add 11, it's like taking away 11 from 25 because both are in the negative and positive. So, 25 minus 11 is 14, and since the larger number is negative, the result is −14. So, that's −14.

Looking at the options, option B is −14. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it: −25 − (−11) = −25 + 11. Since 11 is less than 25, the result is negative, and the difference is 14. So, yes, −14 is correct. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. So, the answer should be B.

The expression −25 − (−11) simplifies to −25 + 11, which equals −14.

Answer: B
