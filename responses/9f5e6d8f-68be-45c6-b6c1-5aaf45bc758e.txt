Question:

5.5-9. Suppose that the length of life in hours (say, $X$ ) of a light bulb manufactured by company $A$ is $N(800,14400)$ and the length of life in hours (say, $Y$ ) of a light bulb manufactured by company $B$ is $N(850,2500)$. One bulb is randomly selected from each company and is burned until "death."
(a) Find the probability that the length of life of the bulb from company $A$ exceeds the length of life of the bulb from company $B$ by at least 15 hours.


Options:

A: $0.3498$
B: $0.1256$
C: $0.2187$
D:  $0.3085$
E: $0.3654$
F: $0.4112$
G: $0.5000$
H: $0.4256$
I: $0.2753$
J: $0.1587$

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about two companies making light bulbs. Let me try to understand what's being asked. 

The problem says that the length of life in hours for a bulb from company A is normally distributed with a mean of 800 and a variance of 14400. For company B, their bulb has a mean of 850 hours and a variance of 2500. We're supposed to find the probability that the bulb from company A lasts at least 15 hours longer than the one from company B. 

Hmm, okay, so we have two independent normal variables here, X for company A and Y for company B. I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving two normal variables, it's often helpful to consider their difference or sum. Since the question is about X exceeding Y by at least 15 hours, I think we need to look at the difference X - Y.

Let me write that down. So, let's define a new variable, let's say D = X - Y. Since X and Y are both normal, their difference D will also be normal. The mean of D should be the difference of the means, so that's 800 (from X) minus 850 (from Y), which is -50. The variance of D would be the sum of the variances of X and Y because they're independent. So, Var(X) is 14400 and Var(Y) is 2500. Adding those gives 14400 + 2500 = 16900. Therefore, the standard deviation of D is the square root of 16900, which is 130.

So, D ~ N(-50, 130²). Now, the problem asks for the probability that X exceeds Y by at least 15 hours, which translates to X - Y >= 15. That means we need P(D >= 15). 

Wait, D is normally distributed, so I can standardize this. The z-score for D =15 would be (15 - μ_D)/σ_D. Plugging in the numbers, that's (15 - (-50))/130 = (65)/130 = 0.5. So, we're looking for P(Z >= 0.5), where Z is the standard normal variable.

I remember that the standard normal distribution tables give the probability that Z is less than a certain value. So, P(Z < 0.5) is about 0.6915. Therefore, P(Z >= 0.5) would be 1 - 0.6915 = 0.3085.

Looking at the options, D is 0.3085. So, that should be the answer.

The difference between the lifespans, D = X - Y, is normally distributed with mean -50 and standard deviation 130. To find P(D ≥ 15), we calculate the z-score as (15 - (-50))/130 = 0.5. Using the standard normal distribution, P(Z ≥ 0.5) = 1 - 0.6915 = 0.3085.

Answer: D
