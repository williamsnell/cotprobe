Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about freezing point depression and dissociation of particles. Let's see what I can figure out. The question is asking what percent of AB particles dissociate when the freezing point of a 0.0100 m AB solution is -0.0193°C. The freezing point lowering constant Kf is given as 1.86°C/mol.

First, I remember that freezing point depression, ΔTf, is calculated using the formula ΔTf = i * Kf * m, where i is the van't Hoff factor, Kf is the freezing point depression constant, and m is the molality of the solution.

In this case, the solution's freezing point is -0.0193°C. Wait, but wait a second, the formula gives a change from the pure solvent's freezing point. Since water normally freezes at 0°C, the change here would be the difference, which is 0.0193°C. But wait, the formula is ΔTf = T_f pure - T_f soln. So if the solution's freezing point is lower (more negative), ΔTf would be positive. So here, ΔTf is 0.0193°C.

So, plugging into the formula: 0.0193 = i * 1.86 * 0.0100.

Let me compute the right side. 1.86 * 0.01 is 0.0186. So 0.0193 = i * 0.0186.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 0.0193 divided by 0.0186 is approximately 1.037. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake because the actual calculation: 0.0193 / (1.86 * 0.01) would be 0.0193 / 0.0186 ≈ 1.037. So i ≈ 1.037. But wait, the van't Hoff factor i is the number of particles the solute dissociates into. AB could dissociate into A+ and B- ions, so if it dissociates completely, i would be 2. If it doesn't dissociate at all, i would be 1.

But here, i is approximately 1.037, which is just a bit more than 1. That suggests that the dissociation is minimal. So perhaps i is approximately 1, but slightly more. Let's think again. Wait, maybe I should calculate it accurately.

Let me write it out:

ΔTf = i * Kf * m
0.0193 = i * 1.86 * 0.0100

Compute 1.86 * 0.01 = 0.0186.

So 0.0193 = i * 0.0186 → i = 0.0193 / 0.0186 ≈ 1.0376.

Hmm, so i is about 1.0376. That suggests that on average, each mole of AB produces about 1.0376 particles. Since AB can dissociate into two ions, but in this case, the i is only a little over 1, so most of the AB isn't dissociating.

Wait, but if AB dissociates into two ions, then if it dissociates completely, i would be 2. If it doesn't dissociate at all, i is 1. So in this case, the i is about 1.0376, which is a little over 1. So that means that a small fraction of the AB is dissociated.

Let me think about how to model this. Let's assume that the degree of dissociation is α. So, the AB dissociates as AB ↔ A+ + B-. The initial concentration is 0.0100 m AB. At dissociation, the concentration of AB decreases by α, and the concentrations of A+ and B- each increase by α. So, the total concentration of particles is (1 - α) * 1 + α * 2 = 1 + α. Wait, that's because for each AB that dissociates, we get two particles. So the total i would be 1 + α. Because the undissociated AB contributes 1, and each dissociated AB contributes 2, so the average is 1 + α.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to model it as i = 1 + 2α, because each dissociated AB contributes 2 particles, so the van't Hoff factor is 1 (if it didn't dissociate) plus 2 times the fraction that does dissociate. Wait, no, I think I might have it wrong. Let me think again.

If AB dissociates to A+ and B-, then for each mole of AB that dissociates, you get two moles of ions, so the total particles increase by 1 per mole of AB. So, the number of particles is 1 (from undissociated AB) plus 1 (from each dissociated AB). So, if α is the fraction dissociated, then the total i is 1 + α * 1 (since each AB gives two ions, so one extra particle per AB). Wait, no, wait: each AB that dissociates contributes two particles, so the total particles are 1*(1-α) + 2*(α) = 1 - α + 2α = 1 + α. So i = 1 + α.

Wait, but that can't be right because when α is 1 (complete dissociation), i would be 2, which is correct. When α is 0, i is 1, which is correct. So yes, i = 1 + α.

But in our case, i is approximately 1.0376. So 1 + α = 1.0376 → α = 0.0376. So α is approximately 3.76%, which is about 3.76%. But the options given are A:12%, B:6%, up to J:7%.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation. Let me compute i again. 0.0193 divided by (1.86 * 0.0100) is 0.0193 / 0.0186 ≈ 1.0376. So that's correct.

So α is about 3.76%. Looking at the options, the closest is option H:3%. But option J is 7%, which is higher. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the model. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the approach is different. Because when a solution is made with a strong electrolyte, i is the number of particles. For a weak electrolyte like AB, which only partially dissociates, the calculation is a bit more involved. So perhaps I should use the assumption that the solution is dilute, and the degree of dissociation is small, so that we can approximate using the formula for weak electrolytes.

The formula for freezing point depression in such cases is ΔTf = (i) * Kf * m, where i is the van't Hoff factor. For a weak electrolyte AB dissociating into A+ and B-, the van't Hoff factor is i = 1 + α, as we discussed.

But if α is small, then i ≈ 1 + α. So, from ΔTf = i * Kf * m, we can write i = ΔTf / (Kf * m). Plugging in the numbers: ΔTf is 0.0193°C, Kf is 1.86, m is 0.0100.

So i = 0.0193 / (1.86 * 0.01) = 0.0193 / 0.0186 ≈ 1.0376.

So i = 1.0376.

Since i = 1 + α, then α = i -1 = 0.0376, or about 3.76%.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula for a weak electrolyte, so the van't Hoff factor is given by i = 1 + 2α, where α is the degree of dissociation. Wait, no, that's not correct because each dissociation of AB gives two ions, so each AB that dissociates adds one more particle (since 1 AB becomes 2 ions, so the number of particles increases by 1). So the correct approach is i = 1 + α, where α is the fraction of AB that dissociates.

Wait, but let me confirm. If all AB dissociates, then each mole gives two ions, so i=2. If none dissociates, i=1. So i = 1 + α * (2-1) = 1 + α. So yes, i =1 + α.

So with i=1.0376, α=0.0376, which is 3.76%.

But the options don't have 3.76%. The closest is H:3%, but another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔTf.

Wait, wait, the freezing point of the solution is -0.0193°C, so the freezing point depression is 0.0193°C (since it's 0.0193 below 0°C). So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for freezing point depression for a weak electrolyte should consider the degree of dissociation differently.

Another approach: For a weak electrolyte, the van't Hoff factor i is calculated as i = 1 + α, and the freezing point depression is ΔTf = i * Kf * m.

So, the formula is correct. So, with i=1.0376, α=0.0376, which is about 3.76%. The options don't have this, but perhaps I should check if I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me compute 0.0193 divided by (1.86 * 0.0100) again.

1.86 * 0.01 = 0.0186.

0.0193 / 0.0186 = approximately 1.0376.

Yes, that's correct.

So the dissociation is about 3.76%, which is close to option H:3% and option J:7%. 3.76 is closer to 4%, but the options don't have 4%. The closest is H:3% or perhaps F:4%, but F is 4% and J is7%.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the formula is i = 1 + 2α. Wait, no, that would be incorrect because each AB that dissociates contributes two particles, so each AB that dissociates adds one more particle beyond the initial one. So i =1 + α, where α is the fraction dissociated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it using the exact formula for weak electrolytes, considering the degree of dissociation. Let me think about it.

The van't Hoff factor i can also be expressed as i = (1 + α), where α is the degree of dissociation. So, we have:

ΔTf = Kf * m * (1 + α).

So, 0.0193 = 1.86 * 0.01 * (1 + α).

Compute 1.86 * 0.01 = 0.0186.

So, 0.0193 = 0.0186 * (1 + α).

Divide both sides by 0.0186: 0.0193 / 0.0186 ≈ 1.0376 = 1 + α.

So, α ≈ 0.0376, which is 3.76%.

So again, 3.76% dissociation. The options don't have this exactly, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider that AB dissociates into A+ and B-, so the formula is AB ↔ A+ + B-.

The initial concentration is 0.0100 m AB. Let the change be x, which is the amount dissociated. So, at equilibrium:

[AB] = 0.0100 - x,

[A+] = x,

[B-] = x.

The van't Hoff factor i is the total particles, which is (0.0100 - x) + x + x = 0.0100 + x. Because each AB that dissociates adds one more particle (since 1 AB becomes 2 ions, so net +1 per x).

So, i = 1 + (x / 0.0100) → because x is the amount dissociated, so x/0.01 is the fraction.

Wait, no, because x is in moles, but m is 0.0100 m, so x is in terms of m. So, the fraction dissociated is x / 0.0100. So, i = 1 + (x / 0.0100).

Wait, but the formula is i = 1 + (x / m), but since m is 0.01, it's 1 + (x / 0.01).

So, from the freezing point depression formula:

ΔTf = i * Kf * m → 0.0193 = (1 + x/0.01) * 1.86 * 0.01.

Simplify the right side:

(1 + x/0.01) * 1.86 * 0.01 = (1 + x/0.01) * 0.0186.

So,

0.0193 = 0.0186 * (1 + x/0.01).

Divide both sides by 0.0186:

0.0193 / 0.0186 ≈ 1.0376 = 1 + x/0.01.

So, x/0.01 = 0.0376 → x = 0.01 * 0.0376 = 0.000376 m.

So, the fraction dissociated is x / 0.01 = 0.0376, or 3.76%.

Again, same result. So, the dissociation is about 3.76%, which is approximately 3.8%. The closest option is H:3%.

But wait, the options are A:12%, B:6%, C:8%, D:10%, E:2%, F:4%, G:15%, H:3%, I:5%, J:7%.

So, 3.76% is closest to H:3%.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is using the approximation that i = 1 + 2α, where α is the degree of dissociation, but that doesn't make sense because each dissociation would add one more particle, not two.

Wait, wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for i is i = 1 + 2α, because each dissociation produces two ions. But that would be incorrect because the initial AB is one particle, and each dissociation adds one more particle (from 1 to 2). So, the correct formula is i = 1 + α, where α is the fraction dissociated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for i is i = 2α + (1 - α) = 1 + α, which is the same as before.

So, I think my initial approach is correct, leading to α ≈3.76%, which is about 3.8%. So the closest option is H:3%.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the freezing point depression formula should be applied considering the actual dissociation. Let me model it using the exact expression.

The van't Hoff factor i is given by i = 1 + α, where α is the degree of dissociation. The formula for ΔTf is i * Kf * m.

So, ΔTf = (1 + α) * Kf * m.

We can solve for α:

α = (ΔTf)/(Kf * m) - 1.

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔTf = 0.0193°C,

Kf = 1.86,

m = 0.0100.

So,

(ΔTf)/(Kf * m) = 0.0193 / (1.86 * 0.0100) = 0.0193 / 0.0186 ≈ 1.0376.

So,

α = 1.0376 - 1 = 0.0376, or 3.76%.

Hmm, same result again.

So, the dissociation is approximately 3.76%, which is closest to 3.8%, so H:3% is the closest option.

But wait, looking back at the options, J is 7%, which is higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of 0.0193 divided by 0.0186.

Compute 0.0193 ÷ 0.0186:

0.0186 * 1 = 0.0186 → 0.0193 - 0.0186 = 0.0007.

So, 0.0007 / 0.0186 ≈ 0.0376.

So, 1.0376 → correct.

So, α is 0.0376, which is 3.76%.

Thus, the correct answer is approximately 3.76%, so the closest option is H:3%.

To determine the percentage of AB particles dissociated, we use the freezing point depression formula:

\[
\Delta T_f = i \cdot K_f \cdot m
\]

Here, \( \Delta T_f \) is the freezing point depression, \( K_f \) is the freezing point lowering constant of water (\( 1.86 \, \text{°C/mol} \)), and \( m \) is the molality of the solution (\( 0.0100 \, \text{mol/kg} \)). The freezing point of the solution is \( -0.0193 \, \text{°C} \), so:

\[
\Delta T_f = 0.0193 \, \text{°C}.
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
0.0193 = i \cdot 1.86 \cdot 0.0100.
\]

Simplify \( 1.86 \cdot 0.0100 = 0.0186 \), so:

\[
0.0193 = i \cdot 0.0186.
\]

Solving for \( i \):

\[
i = \frac{0.0193}{0.0186} \approx 1.0376.
\]

The van’t Hoff factor \( i \) represents the number of particles in solution. For AB, which dissociates as \( \text{AB} \leftrightarrow \text{A}^+ + \text{B}^- \), the relationship between \( i \) and the degree of dissociation \( \alpha \) is:

\[
i = 1 + \alpha.
\]

Thus:

\[
1 + \alpha = 1.0376 \implies \alpha = 0.0376.
\]

The degree of dissociation \( \alpha \) is approximately \( 3.76\% \). Among the given options, the closest value is \( 3\% \).
