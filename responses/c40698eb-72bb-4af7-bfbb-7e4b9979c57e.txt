Question:

A woman sued her former employer in state court, asserting age and sex discrimination claims under both state and federal law. The woman's attorney had recently been embarrassed in court by the judge to whom the case was assigned. Wishing to avoid difficulties with the judge, the woman's attorney promptly removed the case to federal court on the basis of federal-question jurisdiction. The employer's attorney has timely moved to remand. How is the federal court likely to proceed?

Options:

A: Retain the case, because the employer's attorney did not provide sufficient reasons for remand.
B: Remand the entire case.
C: Retain the case to avoid the risk of bias and impropriety in having it proceed before a judge who has shown clear hostility toward the woman's attorney.
D: Retain the case, because the woman's attorney has a valid concern about possible bias in state court.
E: Retain the case, as federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over federal claims.
F: Retain the case, as the employer's attorney has not objected to the removal.
G: Retain the case, because it was timely removed and the woman alleges federal claims.
H: Remand the state claims but keep the federal claims.

Okay, so I've got this question about federal and state court jurisdiction, and I need to figure out how the federal court is likely to proceed. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A woman sued her employer in state court, claiming age and sex discrimination under both state and federal laws. Her attorney removed the case to federal court because the state judge had embarrassed them, and they wanted to avoid difficulties with that judge. Now, the employer's attorney has moved to remand the case back to state court.

I remember that when a case is removed to federal court, the defendant (here, the employer) can file a motion to remand. The court has to decide whether to send it back or keep it.

The question is about whether the federal court will retain the case or remand it. The options are A through H.

I think about the rules of removal jurisdiction. Normally, a case can be removed to federal court if it originally could have been brought there. Here, the case involves federal claims under both state and federal laws, so federal jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 (federal question) and maybe ยง 1367 (supplementary jurisdiction for state claims).

But when a defendant removes a case, the plaintiff (here, the woman) can challenge that removal. The woman's attorney removed the case because they were uncomfortable with the state judge, but the employer is now asking to remand.

I recall that federal courts have some discretion in these matters. If the removal was improper for some reason, the court can remand. But generally, a federal court has the authority to hear cases within its jurisdiction, and if the removal was proper, it might retain the case.

Wait, but there's also the concept of forum shopping. If a party removes a case just because they don't like the state judge, that might be improper. But I'm not sure if that's enough grounds for the court to remand. I think the court's focus is more on whether the case has proper jurisdictional grounds, not on the parties' strategic motives.

In this case, the woman's attorney removed the case on the basis of federal-question jurisdiction, which is valid because the case involves federal discrimination laws. So the removal was timely and proper on jurisdictional grounds.

Now, the employer's attorney moved to remand. The court would look at whether the case properly belongs in federal court. Since there are federal claims, federal court has jurisdiction. The fact that the woman's attorney wanted to avoid a biased judge is a reason for removal, but the court is supposed to decide based on the merits of jurisdiction, not the parties' strategic moves unless there's abuse of process.

So, the court is likely to retain the case because the removal was proper. The employer's motion to remand might not be granted just because the plaintiff's attorney disliked the state judge. Unless there's a specific reason like improper removal or lack of jurisdiction, the court should keep the case.

Looking at the options, option B suggests remanding the entire case, which I don't think is correct because the removal was proper. Option G says retain because it was timely and she alleges federal claims, which seems correct. Option D talks about avoiding bias, but I don't think the federal court would base its decision on the state judge's bias towards the attorney. The focus is on jurisdiction, not the judge's attitude.

So, the correct answer should be that the federal court retains the case. Among the options, G says, "Retain the case, because it was timely removed and the woman alleges federal claims." That fits because the removal was timely and there are federal claims, so federal jurisdiction exists.

The case was properly removed to federal court based on federal-question jurisdiction due to the federal discrimination claims. The employer's motion to remand is likely to be denied because the removal was timely and jurisdictionally sound. The court focuses on jurisdictional grounds rather than the parties' strategic motives, such as dislike of the state judge. Therefore, the federal court will retain the case.

Answer: G
