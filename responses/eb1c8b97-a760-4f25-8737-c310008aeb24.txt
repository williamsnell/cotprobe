Okay, so I have this probability question here about getting exactly three heads in five flips of a balanced coin. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with coins and probabilities, it often involves combinations and the binomial formula. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I think a balanced coin has a 50% chance of landing heads and 50% tails on each flip. So each flip is independent, right? Now, the question is asking for the probability of getting exactly three heads out of five flips. 

I recall that the formula for this kind of problem is the binomial probability formula. The formula is: 

P = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.
- p is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, getting heads, so p=0.5)
- n is the number of trials (flips), which is 5 here.
- k is the number of successes we want, which is 3.

So, I need to calculate C(5,3) first. C(n,k) is calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!).

Let me compute that. 5! is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120. 3! is 6, and (5-3)! is 2! which is 2. So C(5,3) is 120 / (6 * 2) = 120 / 12 = 10. So there are 10 ways to get exactly three heads in five flips.

Next, each of these outcomes has a probability of (0.5)^3 for the heads and (0.5)^(5-3) for the tails. So that's 0.5^5, which is 1/32. Wait, but since each outcome is equally likely, and there are 10 such favorable outcomes, the total probability is 10 * (1/32).

Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 32 is equal to 0.3125. To get the percentage, I multiply by 100, so that's 31.25%.

Looking at the options, option G is 31.25 percent. So that must be the correct answer. I think I did everything right, but let me double-check.

Wait, another way to think about it: the total number of possible outcomes is 2^5 = 32. And the number of favorable outcomes is C(5,3)=10. So 10/32 is indeed 0.3125, or 31.25%. Yep, that makes sense. I think I'm confident with this answer.

The probability of getting exactly three heads in five flips of a balanced coin is calculated using the binomial formula. There are \( C(5,3) = 10 \) favorable outcomes, and each outcome has a probability of \( (0.5)^5 = \frac{1}{32} \). Multiplying these gives \( \frac{10}{32} = 0.3125 \), or 31.25%. 

Answer: G
