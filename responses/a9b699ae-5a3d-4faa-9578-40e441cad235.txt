The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Landowner's property was landlocked. He had to go to court to ask the court to compel the adjacent landowner to give him an easement of necessity for ingress and egress to the highway. The court granted the easement of necessity to Landowner. Over a decade later, another access route to the highway opened up through public improvements. The adjacent landowner sued to stop Landowner from continuing to use his land for ingress and egress. What will the court most likely rule in this case?

Options:

A: The easement is terminated because it cannot exceed five years in length, without being formally renewed by both parties.
B: The easement is terminated because the landowner did not pay for its use.
C: The easement continues because it was granted by the court.
D: The holder of the easement has a right to insist on its uninterrupted continuance.
E: The easement should be modified, not terminated, because the new route may not always be available.
F: The equities favor the termination of the easement where another route is available.
G: The court will most likely rule in favor of the landowner as he has used the easement for over a decade.
H: The easement will continue until the holder of the easement chooses to release it.
I: The easement continues because its purpose of access to the property still exists.

Okay, so I have this legal question about easements, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a landowner whose property became landlocked, meaning he couldn't access his land without going across someone else's property. He went to court to get an easement of necessity for ingress and egress, which means the right to enter and exit the highway. The court granted this easement.

Now, over a decade later, a new access route opened up through public improvements. The adjacent landowner is suing to stop the original landowner from using the easement. The question is, what will the court most likely rule?

I remember that easements are property interests, and they can be created for specific purposes. An easement of necessity is typically created when there's a pressing need, like when a property is landlocked. These easements are generally considered to last as long as the necessity exists.

So, the key here is whether the easement's necessity still exists after the new access route opened. The original easement was granted because the land was landlocked, but now there's another way to access the highway. Does that mean the necessity has been removed?

I think about the doctrine of "necessity." If the purpose of the easement is no longer necessary because another route is available, the easement might be terminated. But I'm not sure if it's automatically terminated or if the court considers other factors.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the easement ends because it can't exceed five years without renewal. But I don't think there's a time limit on easements of necessity unless specified. So A might not be correct.

Option B mentions termination because the landowner didn't pay. But easements of necessity are typically non-fee simple; they don't require payment because they're based on necessity, not a contract. So B seems incorrect.

Option C says the easement continues because it was granted by the court. While the court did grant it, the question is whether the necessity still exists. So C might not be the right answer.

Option D talks about the right to uninterrupted use. I'm not sure if that's a factor here. The issue is necessity, not whether it's been used continuously.

Option E suggests modifying the easement instead of terminating it because the new route might not always be available. That's a possibility, but the question is about termination, not modification.

Option F states that the equities favor termination because another route is available. This seems plausible because the necessity has been removed, so the easement might no longer be justified.

Option G says the court will rule in favor of the landowner because he's used it for over a decade. But usage alone doesn't necessarily keep the easement if the necessity is gone.

Option H says the easement continues until the holder releases it. That sounds more like a general easement without a specific term, but the necessity might have ended.

Option I claims the easement continues because the purpose still exists. But if there's another access, the purpose might not be as necessary anymore.

So, considering all this, the most likely answer is F or E. But I'm leaning towards F because once the necessity is removed, the easement can be terminated. The fact that a new route is available means the original need is gone, so the court would likely rule in favor of termination.

The court is most likely to rule that the easement is terminated because the necessity for it has been removed with the availability of a new access route. 

Answer: F
