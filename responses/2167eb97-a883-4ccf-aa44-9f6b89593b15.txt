Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what 'gai' means when you order it at a Thai restaurant. I know a little bit about Thai cuisine, but I'm not an expert, so I'll have to think this through carefully.

First, I remember that Thai has a lot of street food terms that might not translate directly to English. I've heard of things like "gai" before, maybe in the context of street food or popular dishes. Let me try to recall any Thai dishes that start with 'gai' or are commonly ordered.

I think 'gai' might be related to chicken because I've heard of "gai pad" somewhere. Pad usually means stir-fried, so maybe "gai pad" is a stir-fried chicken dish. If that's the case, then ordering 'gai' would likely get you chicken.

Looking at the options, H is chicken. So that seems to fit. But wait, are there other possibilities? Let me think of other Thai dishes. There's "tom yam goong" which is a shrimp soup, but that's 'goong', not 'gai'. Then there's "gai yang" which is grilled chicken, but again, 'gai' is chicken there.

Another thought: sometimes in Thai, 'gai' could be part of a dish name, but the main ingredient is chicken. So if you just order 'gai', they might bring you chicken, maybe in its simplest form, like fried or grilled.

Wait, could it be something else? Let me see the options again. A is rice, which is common but usually you specify the type of rice. B is vegetables, but that's too broad. C is noodles, but I don't think 'gai' refers to a noodle dish. D is duck, which I don't recall being associated with 'gai'. E is tofu, F is shrimp, G is fish, H is chicken, I is pork, J is beef.

I think I can rule out the other options because 'gai' is more directly linked to chicken. So the answer should be H, chicken.
