Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct ionic symbols for three different elements based on their electron configurations. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question gives three elements with their electron configurations:

(a) z = 11: 1s² 2s² 2p⁶
(b) z = 25: 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 3d⁵
(c) z = 29: 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 3d¹⁰

And I need to match these to the options given, which are A through J. Each option provides three ionic symbols for (a), (b), and (c).

Let me start by determining the atomic number for each configuration. The atomic number (z) is the number of protons, which equals the number of electrons in a neutral atom.

For (a), z=11. The electron configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁶. Let me add up the electrons: 2 + 2 + 6 = 10 electrons. Wait, but z is 11, so it's actually sodium (Na), which has an atomic number of 11. A neutral Na atom has 11 electrons, but the configuration given has only 10. That means it must have lost one electron to become Na⁺. So the ion for (a) is Na⁺.

Next, (b) has z=25. Let me calculate the number of electrons. The configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 3d⁵. Adding those up: 2+2=4, +6=10, +2=12, +6=18, +5=23 electrons. So a neutral atom would have 25 electrons, but this has 23. That means it lost two electrons, so the charge is +2. What element is z=25? That's manganese (Mn). Wait, no, wait. Wait, z=25 is manganese? No, wait, z=25 is actually manganese. Let me check: the periodic table order. Let's see, z=1 is H, up to z=25: magnesium is 12, aluminum 13, silicon 14, phosphorus 15, sulfur 16, chlorine 17, argon 18, potassium 19, calcium 20, then the transition metals: Scandium 21, titanium 22, vanadium 23, chromium 24, manganese 25. Oh wait, no, chromium is 24, so z=25 is manganese. Hmm, but wait, sometimes the electron configurations for transition metals can be a bit tricky. Let me think: the electron configuration given is 3d⁵. So for element 25, if it's losing two electrons, it would lose the s electrons first. So neutral Mn has an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d⁵ 4s². So when it loses two electrons (to become Mn²+), it would lose the 4s electrons, leaving [Ar] 3d⁵. So the ion is Mn²+.

Wait, but let me double-check. Other possibility: sometimes transition metals have different common charges. For example, iron (Fe) is z=26. Oh wait, in the given (b), z=25 is Mn. So the ion would be Mn²+.

Now, looking at the options, let me see which option has (a) as Na⁺ and (b) as Mn²+. Let me check the options.

Option A: (a) K⁺, which is z=19, not 11. So no.

Option B: (a) F⁻, z=9, no.

Option C: (a) Mg⁺, z=12, no.

Option D: (a) Ne⁺, Ne is noble gas, z=10, no.

Option E: (a) Be²+, Be is 4, no.

Option F: (a) Al³+, z=13, no.

Option G: (a) Na⁺, yes. Then (b) Mn²+? Let me check option G. G says (b) Mn²+. So (a) Na⁺, (b) Mn²+, then (c) is Cu⁺¹. Wait, let me check (c).

(c) has z=29. The electron configuration is [Ar] 3d¹⁰. So z=29 is copper (Cu), which has an atomic number of 29. The neutral atom would have 29 electrons, but the configuration here is 3d¹⁰. Let's count: 1s² (2) + 2s² 2p⁶ (8) + 3s² 3p⁶ (8) + 3d¹⁰ (10) = total of 28 electrons. So it has lost one electron, making it Cu⁺. Wait, but wait: another possibility. Alternatively, sometimes copper can have a +2 charge, but in this case, since it's losing one electron, it's +1. Hmm, but wait: let me think again. The neutral Cu atom has 29 electrons. If the configuration given is [Ar] 3d¹⁰, that's 2+8+8+10 = 28 electrons, so it's lost one, so Cu⁺. But wait, the common charge for Cu is usually +2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's recount. The configuration given for (c): 1s² (2) + 2s² 2p⁶ (8) + 3s² 3p⁶ (8) + 3d¹⁰ (10) = 2+8=10, +8=18, +10=28 electrons. So z=29, so 29-28= +1 charge. So Cu⁺. So the ion is Cu⁺¹ or Cu⁺.

Wait, but in the options, let me see which ones have (c) as Cu⁺¹. Let's check each option:

Option A: (c) Zn⁺¹. Zn is z=30, but (c) is z=29, so wrong.

Option B: (c) Cu⁺², so that's +2. But our calculation says +1. So B would be wrong for (c).

Option C: (c) Ag⁺¹. Ag is z=47, so no.

Option D: (c) Cu⁺¹. So (c) would be Cu⁺¹. Let me see if option D has (a) Na⁺, (b) Fe³+, (c) Cu⁺¹.

Wait, in option D, (a) is Ne⁺, which is wrong because (a) is z=11, Na. So D's (a) is wrong.

Option E: (a) Be²+, (b) Mn³+, (c) Cu²+. So (a) is wrong, (b) would be Mn³+ but our (b) is Mn²+, and (c) is Cu²+ which doesn't match our calculation of +1. So E is out.

Option F: (c) Cu⁺¹. Let's see option F: (a) Al³+, no. So F is out.

Option G: (c) Cu⁺¹. Let's check option G: (a) Na⁺, (b) Mn²+, (c) Cu⁺¹. That matches our current understanding.

Wait, but let me double-check (b). (b) is z=25, Mn. Its configuration is [Ar]3d⁵, which is correct for Mn²+. Yes, because Mn neutral has 25 electrons, and losing two would give 23, which is 2+8+8+5 = 23. So yes, Mn²+.

So, for (a) Na⁺, (b) Mn²+, (c) Cu⁺¹, which is option G.

Wait, but let me check option J: (a) Na⁺, (b) Fe²+, (c) Ag⁺¹. But (b) is z=25, which is Mn, not Fe. Fe is z=26. So option J's (b) is wrong.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes transition metals can have variable charges. Could (b) be Fe²+ instead of Mn²+? Let me think again. (b) has z=25, which is Mn, not Fe. So option G's (b) is Mn²+, which is correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option J's (b) is Fe²+. Fe is z=26, so for (b) to be Fe²+, it would have to be z=26. But (b) is given as z=25. So option J is wrong for (b). So option G seems correct.

But wait, another possibility: sometimes the electron configuration can be for the ion. Let me think about (c) again. For z=29, copper. The neutral atom has 29 electrons. The configuration given is [Ar]3d¹⁰, which is 28 electrons. So it's lost one, making it Cu⁺. But another possibility is that the ion could have a +2 charge, which would require losing two electrons. Let me see: if it's Cu²+, that would mean losing two electrons, so the configuration would be [Ar]3d⁹. But the given configuration is 3d¹⁰, which is more filled. So that suggests it's Cu⁺, not Cu²+.

Wait, but sometimes in some cases, like for Cu, the common ion is Cu²+. So maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. The neutral Cu atom has 29 electrons. If it loses one electron, it's Cu⁺ with 28 electrons, which matches the given configuration of [Ar]3d¹⁰. So yes, it's Cu⁺.

Therefore, option G's (c) is Cu⁺¹, which matches.

So putting it all together:

(a) Na⁺, (b) Mn²+, (c) Cu⁺¹.

Looking at the options, option G says:

G: (a) Na⁺, (b) Mn²+, (c) Cu⁺¹.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option G.
</think>

The electron configurations provided correspond to three elements. For (a), z=11, the configuration 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ indicates a sodium ion (Na⁺) since it has lost one electron. For (b), z=25, the configuration 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 3d⁵ corresponds to manganese (Mn) losing two electrons, forming Mn²+. For (c), z=29, the configuration 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 3d¹⁰ indicates copper (Cu) losing one electron, forming Cu⁺¹. Matching these with the options, option G correctly identifies (a) as Na⁺, (b) as Mn²+, and (c) as Cu⁺¹.

Answer: G
