Options:

A: Compounded every two years
B: Compounded semiannually
C: Compounded yearly
D: Compounded biannually
E: Compounded weekly
F: Compounded daily
G: Compounded annually
H: Compounded monthly
I: Compounded quarterly
J: Compounded hourly

Answer:
    <think>

Okay, so I've got this question about compounding interest, and I'm supposed to figure out which option makes the most sense for Paul Reilly. Let's see. Let me start by understanding the problem.

Paul deposited $5,000 into a savings account. The interest rate is 4%, and he left it there for three years. He can choose to compound the interest either semiannually, quarterly, or annually. The question is asking which option would give him the most profit.

Hmm, so the key here is to calculate the amount of money he would have after three years under each compounding method and see which one gives the highest final amount. Alternatively, I could just calculate the interest for each method and compare.

I remember the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount ($5,000).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form; 4% is 0.04).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years (3 years here).

So, since the interest is compounded semiannually, quarterly, or annually, I need to compute A for each case.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, for each compounding option, find n:
- Annually: n=1 (compounded once a year)
- Semiannually: n=2 (compounded twice a year)
- Quarterly: n=4
- Compounded monthly: n=12
- Compounded daily: n=365
- Hourly: n=365*24 (but since it's compounded more frequently, it's more profitable than daily but I'm not sure how much more. Maybe for this question, the options are limited to certain intervals.)

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are A to J, and each corresponds to different compounding frequencies. Let's note the options again:

A: Compounded every two years (semiannually)
B: Compounded semiannually
C: Compounded yearly
D: Compounded biannually (same as every two years)
E: Compounded weekly (n=52)
F: Compounded daily (n=365)
G: Compounded annually (n=1)
H: Compounded monthly (n=12)
I: Compounded quarterly (n=4)
J: Compounded hourly (n=365*24, but that's a lot)

So the options are semiannually (A), quarterly (H), annually (C), biannually (D same as A), yearly (C), etc.

I think the correct way is to compute the amount for each and see which is the largest.

Let's compute each one.

First, the formula: A = 5000*(1 + 0.04/n)^(3*n)

Wait, no. Wait, because t is 3 years. So in each case, the exponent is n*3.

So for each case:

1. Annually: n=1
A = 5000*(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*3) = 5000*(1.04)^3

2. Semiannually: n=2
A = 5000*(1 + 0.04/2)^(2*3) = 5000*(1.02)^6

3. Quarterly: n=4
A = 5000*(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*3) =5000*(1.01)^12

4. Annually is the same as C, which is 5000*(1.04)^3.

Wait, for option C, it's compounded yearly. So same as Annually.

Wait wait, looking back at the options, option C is compounded yearly, which is same as Annually, so A and C are the same. So the options would be:

A: Compounded every two years (semiannually)
B: Compounded semiannually (n=2)
C: Compounded yearly (n=1)
D: Compounded biannually (n=2, same as B)
E: Compounded weekly (n=52)
F: Compounded daily (n=365)
G: Compounded annually (n=1, same as C)
H: Compounded monthly (n=12)
I: Compounded quarterly (n=4)
J: Compounded hourly (n=365*24)

So, in the options, options B and A are the same (semiannually), and C is same as G.

So for each option, I'll calculate A as per the formula.

Let me compute each one.

Option B: Semiannually (n=2)
A = 5000*(1.02)^6

Compute 1.02^6: I think 1.02^6 is approximately 1.12616. Let me double-check:

1.02^1 = 1.02
1.02^2 = 1.0404
1.02^3 = 1.061208
1.02^4 ≈ 1.08243216
1.02^5 ≈ 1.10408891
1.02^6 ≈ 1.126162

So, 5000 * 1.126162 ≈ 5630.81.

Option A: Annually (n=1)
A = 5000*(1.04)^3

Compute 1.04^3: 1.04 * 1.04 = 1.0816; 1.0816 * 1.04 = 1.124864.

So, 5000 * 1.124864 = 5624.32.

So option A gives slightly less than option B.

Option H: Compounded monthly (n=12)
A =5000*(1 + 0.04/12)^(3*12) =5000*(1.0033333)^36.

Hmm, calculating (1.0033333)^36. That's a bit tricky. Maybe use logarithms or exponent rules. Alternatively, perhaps use the formula step by step for each month, but that's tedious.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest for each month.

Wait, but in reality, 1.0033333^36 is equal to e^(36 * ln(1.0033333)).

Compute ln(1.0033333) ≈ 0.003322.

Multiply by 36: 0.11919.

Then e^0.11919 ≈ 1.1262.

So, approximately 1.1262. So 5000 *1.1262 ≈5631.

Wait, but this is just an approximation. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it in smaller steps. But maybe a better approach is to use the formula for compound interest when compounding more frequently.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate using the formula for each option.

Alternatively, maybe I can compare the options.

Wait, the more frequent the compounding, the higher the interest earned, so higher n leads to higher A.

So, among the options, the highest frequency is quarterly (n=4) (option I), then monthly (n=12, option H), then quarterly (option I). Wait no, option I is quarterly, H is monthly, so in terms of n, H is higher than I.

Wait, wait, no. Let me recount:

I: Compounded quarterly, n=4.

H: Compounded monthly, n=12.

Which one gives higher A? Higher n would give higher A, so monthly compounding would give higher than quarterly? Wait no, wait. No, wait, for the same number of periods, the higher the rate per period, the higher the interest.

Wait, for example, if you have a higher n but smaller r/n, that could have a different effect.

But perhaps the formula is such that higher n leads to higher A for a fixed rate.

Wait, for example, let's imagine that for a given t, when you increase n, A increases.

Wait, so if we have the same t, then higher n leads to higher A because the effective rate per period increases.

So, for 3 years, which has the highest n? It's monthly (n=12), then quarterly (n=4), then semiannually (n=2), then yearly (n=1). So, the more frequent the compounding, the higher the amount.

So, if Paul can choose between compounding once a month (H) or once a year (C), H would give more interest.

So, let's compare H and C.

Compute A for H (n=12) and C (n=1).

n=1: (1+0.04/1)^(3*1) =1.04^3=1.124864. So 5000*1.124864=5624.32.

n=12: (1+0.04/12)^(36) = (1.0033333)^36.

I think (1.0033333)^36 can be computed as e^(36 * ln(1.0033333)).

Compute ln(1.0033333) ≈ 0.0033213.

Multiply by 36: 0.11920.

e^0.11920 ≈ 1.12616.

So 5000 *1.12616=5630.8.

Thus, compounding monthly gives higher A than yearly.

So, if Paul can choose between semiannually and monthly, he would prefer the higher interest rate, which is higher n.

So, now, looking at the options again:

Option H: Compounded monthly (n=12) → higher than option C (n=1) → gives higher A.

Similarly, quarterly (I) has n=4, which is less than 12, so the amount would be less than H.

Thus, the most profitable option would be H: Compounded monthly.

Alternatively, other options may be more profitable than others.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the more frequent the compounding (higher n), the higher the effective annual rate (EAR). So, the higher n, the higher the effective rate, which leads to higher A.

So, the options are:

A: n=2 (semi)
B: n=1 (yearly)
C: n=1 (same as B)
D: n=2 (same as A)
E: n=52
F: n=365
G: n=1 (same as C)
H: n=12
I: n=4
J: n=365*24=9180.

So, the higher n values (H, I, F) give higher effective rates, so higher A.

So, among the options, H is monthly (n=12), which would give the highest A. So Paul would prefer H to get more interest.

Wait, but wait. Wait, there's a confusion here. I think I mixed up the options. Let me recheck.

Wait, the options are A to J:

A: Every two years → n=2 (semiannually)
B: Semiannually → n=2
C: Annually → n=1
D: Biannually → n=2
E: Weekly → n=52
F: Daily → n=365
G: Annually → same as C
H: Monthly → n=12
I: Quarterly → n=4
J: Hourly → n=365*24=9180.

So, among the options, the highest n is H (12), then I (4), then E (52), then F (365), then J (9180), then A (2), B (2), C (1), D (2), etc.

So, H is the highest n, then I, then E, then F, then J, then A and B.

Thus, the option with the highest n (J) is compounded hourly, which would give the highest interest earned.

Wait, but that's not matching my earlier calculation. Because when I did H (n=12) and C (n=1), I got that H gives a higher A.

Wait, but in the initial question, the options include H and I, which are different n's. So, if Paul can choose between H and I, which gives a higher A?

Wait, let's compute the A for I (n=4) and H (n=12).

Compute for I (n=4):

A =5000*(1 + 0.04/4)^(3*4)=5000*(1.01)^12.

1.01^12 is approximately 1.126825.

So, 5000 *1.126825 ≈5634.125.

For H (n=12):

A=5000*(1.0033333)^36 ≈5630.81.

So, I (n=4) gives about 5634.13, which is higher than H's 5630.81.

Wait, that's higher. So, at n=4, the amount is 5634.13, which is higher than H's 5630.81.

So, if the options include both I and H, then I is more profitable than H.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, for I, which is n=4, the exponent is 3*4=12. So, 1.01^12= approx 1.126825.

Multiply by 5000: 5000 *1.126825=5634.125.

For H (n=12), 3*12=36 periods. So (1.0033333)^36.

Compute 1.0033333^36.

Hmm, perhaps using logarithms.

ln(1.0033333)= approx 0.0033213.

36 *0.0033213=0.1195668.

e^0.1195668≈1.1263.

So, 5000*1.1263≈5631.5.

Wait, so H gives about 5631.5, I gives 5634.13. So, I (n=4) is slightly better.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier because I thought that 1.01^12 is about 1.1268, but 1.003333^36 is about 1.1263, which is a little less than 1.1268.

Wait, let me compute 1.0033333^36 more accurately.

Alternatively, using the formula (1 + r)^n, where r=0.04/12=0.0033333.

n=36.

So, 1.0033333^36.

Let me compute this step by step.

Let me compute 1.0033333^36.

Alternatively, perhaps using the rule that (1 + r)^n ≈ e^(n*r) for small r. So, 36*0.0033333=0.12.

e^0.12≈1.1275.

But that's a rough estimate. The actual value is slightly less, because the approximation is for small r. The exact value is 1.0033333^36= (1 + 0.0033333)^36.

Hmm, perhaps using a calculator isn't feasible, but I can accept that 1.0033333^36 is approximately 1.1262.

Which is slightly less than 1.1268, which was 1.01^12. So, I's amount is a bit less than H's.

Thus, I is better than H.

Wait, so if the options are between H and I, I is better.

But wait, let me think again. What if we have more frequent periods? For example, monthly is more than quarterly, which is more than semiannually, etc.

In that case, the more frequent the compounding, the higher the effective rate, and thus higher A.

So, the higher the n, the higher the amount.

So, among the options, J is compounded hourly, which is the highest n, so J would give the highest A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that H (n=12) gives more than I (n=4) but less than C (n=1).

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier because I thought I's A was slightly higher than H's, but that's not correct. H's A is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all the A's to see clearly.

Let me make a table:

Option | n | A =5000*(1 + r)^t
r=0.04/n
t=3

Option A: n=2 (semi)
r=0.02
A=5000*(1.02)^6=5000*1.12616=5630.81

Option B: n=1 (yearly)
r=0.04
A=5000*(1.04)^3=5624.32

Option C: same as B.

Option D: n=2 (semi)
Same as A.

Option E: n=52 (weekly)
r=0.04/52≈0.00076923
t=156 (3 years *52 weeks)
A=5000*(1.00076923)^156.

Calculate 1.00076923^156.

Again, using e^(156 * ln(1.00076923)).

ln(1.00076923)≈0.000768.

156 *0.000768≈0.119168.

e^0.119168≈1.1262.

So, A=5000*1.1262≈5631.

So, E's amount is about 5631.

Option F: n=365 (daily)
r=0.04/365≈0.000109589
t=3*365=1095.

A=5000*(1.000109589)^1095.

Compute 1.000109589^1095.

Using the same method, ln(1.000109589)=approx 0.0001095.

Multiply by 1095: 0.120.

e^0.120≈1.1275.

So, A=5000*1.1275=5637.5.

Option G: n=1 (same as C)
Same as C.

Option H: n=12 (monthly)
r=0.04/12=0.0033333
t=3*12=36.

A=5000*(1.0033333)^36.

Which is approximately 5000 *1.1262=5631.

Option I: n=4 (quarterly)
r=0.04/4=0.01
t=3*4=12.

A=5000*(1.01)^12.

1.01^12=approx 1.126825.

So, A=5000*1.126825≈5634.13.

Option J: n=365*24=9180 (hourly)
r=0.04/9180≈0.000004366.
t=3*9180=27540.

A=5000*(1.000004366)^27540.

Approximate using ln(1.000004366)=approx 0.000004366.

Multiply by 27540: 0.1197.

e^0.1197≈1.1275.

Thus, A=5000*1.1275≈5637.5.

So, summarizing all the A's:

A: 5630.81

B:5624.32

C:5624.32

D:5630.81

E:5631

F:5637.5

G:5631

H:5631

I:5634.13

J:5637.5

Wait, according to this, the maximum A is about 5637.5, which occurs for F and J.

So, F and J both give the same maximum.

But in the options, J is compounded hourly, which is n=9180, which gives the highest A.

So, the correct option would be J, compounded hourly.

Wait, but earlier I thought that I is n=4, which gives 5634.13, which is higher than H's 5631.

So, I's A is higher than H's.

But in the options, J is compounded hourly, which gives the highest A.

So, the answer should be option J.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake because when I calculated for F (n=365) and J (n=9180), both gave the same A of 5637.5. So, which option is better? Since J is compounded more frequently, it should have a higher A than F.

Wait, but the options are:

A: n=2

B: n=1

C: n=1

D: n=2

E: n=52

F: n=365

G: n=1

H: n=12

I: n=4

J: n=9180

So, J is the option with the highest n, so it should have the highest A.

Therefore, the correct answer is J.

Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought that H's n=12 gives A=5631, which is slightly lower than I's 5634.13, which is higher.

But according to the table, F (n=365) and J (n=9180) both give A=5637.5.

So, in that case, J would be the correct answer.

But now I'm confused because earlier I thought that I's A is higher than H's. But according to the table, H's A is 5631, I's is 5634.13, which is higher than H.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for I. Let me recompute I.

I is n=4, so 3 years *4=12 periods.

A=5000*(1 + 0.04/4)^12=5000*(1.01)^12.

1.01^12 is approximately 1.126825.

So, 5000 *1.126825=5634.125.

Which is higher than H's 5631.

So, I's A is higher than H's.

But F (n=365) and J (n=9180) both have the same A of 5637.5.

So, in that case, J's A is the same as F's, but J is compounded more frequently, so it's better.

So, the correct answer is J.

Wait, but in my initial calculations, I thought that H's A is 5631, which is lower than I's 5634.13, which is lower than F's 5637.5.

So, the correct answer is J.

But let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: every two years (n=2)
B: semiannually (n=2)
C: annually (n=1)
D: biannually (n=2)
E: weekly (n=52)
F: daily (n=365)
G: annually (n=1)
H: monthly (n=12)
I: quarterly (n=4)
J: hourly (n=9180)

So, the correct answer is J, which is compounded hourly, giving the highest A.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused because F is compounded daily and J is compounded hourly. Both give the same A because they have the same number of periods, but J has a higher rate per period, which leads to a slightly higher total.

Wait, no, because J is compounded more frequently, so the effective rate is higher, leading to higher A.

Wait, but in the table, both F and J give the same A of 5637.5, which suggests that J is better because it has a higher n.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations for J.

Wait, let me recalculate J.

J: compounded hourly, so 3 years * 24 =72 periods.

r=0.04/72≈0.00055556.

A=5000*(1 +0.00055556)^72.

Compute 1.00055556^72.

Using the approximation that (1 + r)^n ≈ e^(n*r) for small r.

n*r=72*0.00055556≈0.04.

e^0.04≈1.04081077414.

So, 1.00055556^72≈1.04081077414.

Thus, A=5000*1.04081077414≈5204.05.

Wait, that's lower than F's 5637.5.

Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the approximation isn't accurate enough.

The exact value of 1.00055556^72 can be calculated with a calculator.

But without a calculator, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

(1 + r)^n = e^{n ln(1 + r)}.

Compute ln(1.00055556)=approx 0.0005544.

Multiply by 72: 0.04.

e^0.04≈1.04081077414.

So, 5000 *1.04081077414≈5204.05.

But earlier, the table suggested that F (n=365) and J (n=9180) both give 5637.5.

This is a contradiction.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the table.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all A's with more accurate methods.

Let me compute each A accurately.

Option A: n=2 (semi)
A=5000*(1.02)^6=5000*1.12616=5630.81

Option B: n=1 (yearly)
A=5000*(1.04)^3=5000*1.124864=5624.32

Option C: same as B.

Option D: n=2 (semi)
Same as A.

Option E: n=52 (weekly)
A=5000*(1.000157895)^ (52*3)=5000*(1.000157895)^156.

Compute 1.000157895^156.

Using the approximation that (1 + r)^n ≈ e^{n r}.

r=0.000157895, n=156.

n*r=156 *0.000157895≈0.02465.

e^0.02465≈1.0251.

So, 1.0251.

Thus, A=5000*1.0251≈5125.5.

Wait, that's lower than F's 5637.5.

Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each A with precise calculations.

Let me compute each A accurately.

Option A: n=2 (semi)
A=5000*(1.02)^6.

1.02^6=1.12616242.

So, 5000*1.12616242=5630.812.

Option B: n=1 (yearly)
A=5000*(1.04)^3.

1.04^3=1.124864.

So, 5000*1.124864=5624.32.

Option C: same as B.

Option D: n=2 (semi)
Same as A.

Option E: n=52 (weekly)
A=5000*(1 + 0.04/52)^ (52*3).

0.04/52≈0.00076923.

(1 +0.00076923)^156.

Compute 1.00076923^156.

We can compute this using the formula (1 + r)^n = e^{n ln(1 + r)}.

Compute ln(1.00076923)= approx 0.0007683.

Multiply by 156: 156 *0.0007683≈0.1195.

e^0.1195≈1.1262.

So, A=5000*1.1262≈5631.

Option F: n=365 (daily)
A=5000*(1 + 0.04/365)^ (365*3).

0.04/365≈0.000109589.

(1 +0.000109589)^1095.

Compute 1.000109589^1095.

Using the formula (1 + r)^n = e^{n ln(1 + r)}.

ln(1.000109589)=approx 0.000109589.

Multiply by 1095: 1095 *0.000109589≈0.120.

e^0.120≈1.1275.

So, A=5000*1.1275≈5637.5.

Option G: n=1 (same as C).

Option H: n=12 (monthly)
A=5000*(1 +0.04/12)^ (12*3).

0.04/12=0.00333333.

(1 +0.00333333)^36.

Compute 1.00333333^36.

Using the formula (1 + r)^n = e^{n ln(1 + r)}.

ln(1.00333333)=approx 0.0033219.

Multiply by 36: 0.1191826.

e^0.1191826≈1.1263.

So, A=5000*1.1263≈5631.5.

Option I: n=4 (quarterly)
A=5000*(1 +0.04/4)^ (4*3).

0.04/4=0.01.

(1 +0.01)^12.

Compute 1.01^12.

1.01^12=approx 1.126825.

So, A=5000*1.126825≈5634.13.

Option J: n=9180 (hourly)
A=5000*(1 +0.04/9180)^ (9180*3).

0.04/9180≈0.000004366.

(1 +0.000004366)^27540.

Using the formula (1 + r)^n = e^{n ln(1 + r)}.

ln(1.000004366)=approx 0.000004366.

Multiply by 27540: 0.000004366 *27540≈0.120.

e^0.120≈1.1275.

So, A=5000*1.1275≈5637.5.

Wait, so according to this, both F and J give 5637.5, while H and I give 5631.5 and 5634.13 respectively.

So, the maximum A is 5637.5, which occurs for F (n=365) and J (n=9180).

Thus, the correct answer is J, which is compounded hourly, giving the highest A.
</think>

The most profitable option is **J: compounded hourly** because it compounds the principal the most frequently, leading to the highest total amount after 3 years.

**Answer:** J
