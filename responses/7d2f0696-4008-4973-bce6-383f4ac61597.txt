Okay, so I've got this question about finding the current through a capacitor at a specific time, t=0. The capacitor is 0.01 microfarads, and there are three different voltage scenarios given. I'm a bit rusty on my circuit theory, but I'll try to work through each part step by step.

First, I remember that the current through a capacitor is given by the derivative of the voltage across it with respect to time. The formula is I = C * dV/dt, where C is capacitance and dV/dt is the rate of change of voltage.

The capacitor's capacitance is 0.01 μF. Let me convert that into farads because the standard unit is farads. Since 1 μF is 1e-6 F, 0.01 μF is 0.01e-6 F, which is 1e-8 F. So C = 1e-8 F.

Now, there are three parts to the question: (a), (b), and (c). I'll tackle each one separately.

Starting with part (a): The voltage is given as 2 sin(2π10^6 t) volts. To find the current, I need to take the derivative of this voltage with respect to time.

The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), so dV/dt = 2 * cos(2π10^6 t) * 2π10^6. Wait, no, more accurately, the derivative of sin(k t) is k cos(k t). So here, k is 2π10^6. So dV/dt = 2 * (2π10^6) cos(2π10^6 t). So that's 4π10^6 cos(2π10^6 t) volts per second.

Now, plugging into I = C * dV/dt: I = 1e-8 F * 4π10^6 cos(2π10^6 t) A.

Let me compute the numerical factor first. 1e-8 * 4π10^6 = 4π * 1e-2. Since 1e-8 *1e6 is 1e-2, so 4π * 0.01. 4 times π is approximately 12.566, so 12.566 * 0.01 is about 0.12566. So I ≈ 0.12566 * cos(2π10^6 t) A.

At t=0, cos(0) is 1, so the current is 0.12566 A, which is approximately 0.1256 A. Looking at the options, part (a) must be around 0.1256 A. Let me check the options for that value.

Moving on to part (b): The voltage is -2 e^(-10^7 t) V. Again, I need to find dV/dt. The derivative of e^(-kt) is -k e^(-kt), so here, k is 10^7. So dV/dt = -2 * (-10^7) e^(-10^7 t) = 2*10^7 e^(-10^7 t).

Now, I = C * dV/dt = 1e-8 F * 2e7 e^(-10^7 t) A. Let me compute the constants: 1e-8 * 2e7 = 2e-1, which is 0.2. So I = 0.2 e^(-10^7 t) A.

At t=0, e^0 is 1, so I = 0.2 A. So part (b) is 0.2 A. Looking at the options, the second value in each option corresponds to part (b). So looking for 0.2 A.

Now part (c): The voltage is -2 e^(-10^7 t) sin(2π10^6 t) V. This is a product of an exponential decay and a sine function. Taking the derivative will involve using the product rule.

Let me denote V(t) = -2 e^(-at) sin(bt), where a=1e7 and b=2π1e6.

dV/dt = -2 [ d/dt (e^(-at) sin(bt)) ]

Using product rule: d/dt (e^(-at) sin(bt)) = -a e^(-at) sin(bt) + b e^(-at) cos(bt).

So dV/dt = -2 [ -a e^(-at) sin(bt) + b e^(-at) cos(bt) ]

= 2a e^(-at) sin(bt) - 2b e^(-at) cos(bt).

So I = C * [2a e^(-at) sin(bt) - 2b e^(-at) cos(bt)].

Plug in a=1e7, b=2π1e6, C=1e-8.

Compute each term:

First term: 2a C e^(-at) sin(bt) = 2*(1e7)*1e-8 e^(-1e7 t) sin(2π1e6 t) = (2e7 * 1e-8) e^(-...) sin(...) = 0.2 e^(-1e7 t) sin(...).

Second term: -2b C e^(-at) cos(bt) = -2*(2π1e6)*1e-8 e^(-...) cos(...).

Let me compute 2bC: 2*(2π1e6) *1e-8 = 4π1e6 *1e-8 = 4π * 1e-2 ≈ 12.566 * 0.01 ≈ 0.12566. So the second term is -0.12566 e^(-1e7 t) cos(...).

So I = 0.2 e^(-1e7 t) sin(2π1e6 t) - 0.12566 e^(-1e7 t) cos(2π1e6 t) A.

At t=0, e^0 is 1, so:

I = 0.2 sin(0) - 0.12566 cos(0) = 0 - 0.12566 *1 = -0.12566 A ≈ -0.1256 A.

So part (c) is -0.1256 A.

Now, compiling the results:

(a) ≈ 0.1256 A

(b) = 0.2 A

(c) ≈ -0.1256 A

Looking at the options:

Option F: 0.1256 A, 0.2 A, -0.1256 A. That matches exactly.

Wait, but let me double-check each part again.

For part (a), the derivative of 2 sin(2π1e6 t) is 2 * 2π1e6 cos(2π1e6 t) = 4π1e6 cos(...). So I = C * 4π1e6 cos(...). C is 1e-8, so 1e-8 *4π1e6 =4π *1e-2 = ~0.12566. So yes, 0.1256 A at t=0.

Part (b) as 0.2 A is correct.

Part (c) calculation I did but let me recheck:

The derivative of -2 e^(-at) sin(bt) is:

First, d/dt [ e^(-at) ] = -a e^(-at)

d/dt [ sin(bt) ] = b cos(bt)

So using product rule: derivative is -a e^(-at) sin(bt) + b e^(-at) cos(bt), but multiplied by -2.

So the derivative is -2 [ -a e^(-at) sin(bt) + b e^(-at) cos(bt) ] = 2a e^(-at) sin(bt) - 2b e^(-at) cos(bt).

Then, I = C*(2a e^(-at) sin(bt) - 2b e^(-at) cos(bt)).

At t=0, sin(0)=0, cos(0)=1. So I = C*(0 - 2b e^0 ) = -2b C.

Calculating 2bC: 2*(2π1e6)*1e-8 =4π1e6 *1e-8 =4π*1e-2= ~0.12566. So I= -0.12566 A, which is -0.1256 A. So yes, that's correct.

So the three currents are 0.1256, 0.2, -0.1256 A.

Looking at the options, option F is:

F: 0.1256 A, 0.2 A, -0.1256 A.

So the correct answer is F.

The current through the capacitor is calculated by taking the derivative of the voltage across it and multiplying by the capacitance. For each case:

(a) The voltage is \( 2 \sin(2\pi 10^6 t) \). The derivative is \( 4\pi 10^6 \cos(2\pi 10^6 t) \), leading to a current of approximately \( 0.1256 \, \text{A} \) at \( t=0 \).

(b) The voltage is \( -2e^{-10^7 t} \). The derivative is \( 2 \times 10^7 e^{-10^7 t} \), resulting in a current of \( 0.2 \, \text{A} \) at \( t=0 \).

(c) The voltage is \( -2e^{-10^7 t} \sin(2\pi 10^6 t) \). Using the product rule, the derivative leads to a current of approximately \( -0.1256 \, \text{A} \) at \( t=0 \).

Matching these results with the options, the correct choice is:

F: 0.1256 A, 0.2 A, -0.1256 A.
