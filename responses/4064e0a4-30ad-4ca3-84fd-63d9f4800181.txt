Okay, so I've got this question about book value per share for ABC Corporation. Let me see, I remember that book value is like the value of a company as recorded on their balance sheet. It's calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets. Oh right, because assets minus liabilities equals equity. So that gives the book value of the company.

The question says total assets are $75,000 and total liabilities are $52,000. So I should subtract the liabilities from the assets to find the equity. Let me do that math: $75,000 minus $52,000 equals $23,000. So the total equity is $23,000.

Wait, but the question is about book value per share, not total. Oh, right, because the company has 500 shares outstanding. So I need to divide the total equity by the number of shares to get the per share value.

So $23,000 divided by 500 shares. Let me calculate that. 23,000 divided by 500. Hmm, 500 goes into 23,000 how many times? Well, 500 times 46 is 23,000 because 500 times 40 is 20,000, and 500 times 6 is 3,000, adding up to 23,000. So that's 46.

So the book value per share is $46. Looking back at the options, option H is $46 per share. So the answer should be H.

The book value per share is calculated by dividing total equity by the number of shares outstanding. 

1. **Total Equity**: $75,000 (assets) - $52,000 (liabilities) = $23,000.
2. **Per Share Value**: $23,000 / 500 shares = $46 per share.

**Answer: H: $46 per share**

Answer: H
