Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about calculating the change in entropy (ΔS) for a process where the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) is given by the expression ΔG/J = -85.40 + 36.5*(T/K), and the process is at constant pressure. All gases are perfect, and the temperature is 298.15 K unless stated otherwise.

Hmm, I remember that Gibbs free energy change is related to entropy. Oh right, the Gibbs equation at constant pressure is ΔG = VΔP + something else, but wait, I think the key relation here is the one involving entropy. Oh yeah, the differential form of Gibbs free energy is dG = V dP + S dT. But since the process is at constant pressure, dP is zero, so dG = S dT. That makes sense because at constant pressure, the change in Gibbs free energy is related to entropy and temperature change.

Wait, but the problem gives me ΔG as a function of temperature. How do I find ΔS? Oh, I think the formula for ΔG in terms of temperature is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. But wait, that's the equation at a specific temperature, not as a function of T. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The Gibbs free energy change for a process at constant pressure can be expressed as ΔG = nRT ln(Q), but that's for specific processes like chemical reactions. Alternatively, since the problem gives ΔG as a linear function of T, maybe I can differentiate the given expression with respect to T to find ΔS.

Wait, the given ΔG is a function of T: ΔG = -85.40 + 36.5*(T). So, the change in Gibbs energy with temperature is linear. Let me recall that the derivative of ΔG with respect to T at constant pressure gives us the entropy change. Because from the equation dG = S dT at constant pressure, so dG/dT = S. Therefore, the slope of ΔG vs T is S.

Wait, but wait, the expression given is ΔG = a + b*T. So, when I take the derivative of ΔG with respect to T, I get d(ΔG)/dT = b. So in this case, b is 36.5 J/K. But wait, wait a minute. The units need to make sense. Let me check.

The given ΔG is in J, and T is in K. So, the derivative d(ΔG)/dT would have units J/K, which is the unit of entropy. So that's correct. So the slope, which is 36.5, is the entropy change. But wait, I should be careful about the sign. Let me think.

Wait, the equation is ΔG = -85.40 + 36.5*T. So the slope is 36.5 J/(K·J?), wait no, because ΔG is in J and T is in K, so 36.5 would be in J/K. So the derivative d(ΔG)/dT is 36.5 J/K. So that would mean S is 36.5 J/K.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The formula for Gibbs free energy change at constant pressure is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. But wait, in this problem, ΔG is given as a function of T, so perhaps I should consider taking the derivative of ΔG with respect to T.

Alternatively, the relation is that dG = V dP + S dT at constant pressure, so when pressure is constant, dG = S dT. Integrating from initial to final state, the change in G would be the integral of S dT. But in this problem, the change in G is given as a linear function of T, which implies that S is constant. So integrating S dT would be S*(T2 - T1). But wait, the problem doesn't specify the process's initial and final temperatures. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the simpler approach is correct. Since ΔG is expressed as a function of T, the slope of this function with respect to T is the entropy change. So, ΔS = d(ΔG)/dT = 36.5 J/K.

Looking at the options, option D is 36.5 J/K. But wait, I should double-check the signs. The given expression is ΔG = -85.40 + 36.5*T. So the coefficient of T is positive 36.5, which would mean that as T increases, ΔG increases. If d(ΔG)/dT is positive, that would mean S is positive. Is that correct?

Wait, but wait, what is the actual process? The problem states that the process occurs at constant pressure. So the formula for ΔG when pressure is constant is ΔG = V ΔP + (other terms?), but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the general formula is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, but that applies at a specific temperature. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts.

Wait, another approach: The Gibbs free energy equation can be written as ΔG = ∫ (dG) from T1 to T2. At constant pressure, dG = S dT. So, if I integrate S dT from T1 to T2, I get ΔG = S (T2 - T1). But in this problem, ΔG is given as a function of T, so perhaps that function is linear, implying that S is constant. Therefore, the slope of ΔG versus T is S.

Given that ΔG = a + b*T, where a is -85.40 J and b is 36.5 J/K, then d(ΔG)/dT is 36.5 J/K, so S is 36.5 J/K.

So the correct answer is D: 36.5 J/K.

The Gibbs free energy change is given as ΔG = -85.40 + 36.5(T). At constant pressure, the relationship between ΔG and entropy (S) is derived from the differential form of Gibbs free energy: dG = S dT. Integrating this gives ΔG = S(T2 - T1), and since ΔG is linear in T, the slope of ΔG with respect to T is S. The coefficient of T in the given expression is 36.5 J/K, which is the entropy change. Thus, ΔS = 36.5 J/K.
