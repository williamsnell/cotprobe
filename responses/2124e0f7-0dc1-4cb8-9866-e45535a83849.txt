Okay, so I have this question about Wellman and his arguments regarding unlimited property rights. I'm a bit rusty on my political philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what Wellman argues happens if one insists on unlimited property rights. The options are A through J, with various political theories and ideologies.

First, I remember that Wellman is associated with certain philosophical arguments about property rights. I think he's written about the limits of property rights and how unlimited rights can lead to problematic outcomes.

Unlimited property rights would mean that individuals can own as much as they want without any restrictions. But if that's taken to an extreme, what happens? Well, if everyone can own unlimited property, there's a potential for significant inequality. People with more resources could accumulate more, leaving others with very little. That sounds like it could lead to a situation where the majority of wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, which is a critique often made against capitalism. So maybe the answer is related to the implications of such a system.

I also recall that Wellman has discussed the idea that if you take unlimited property rights as a given, it can commit you to certain political positions. For example, if you argue that property rights are absolute, you might end up supporting a system that allows for a lot of inequality, which some argue is a feature of capitalism. Alternatively, it could lead to anarchy if there's no regulation, but anarchy is more about the absence of government, not necessarily the economic system.

Wait, another angle: Wellman might argue that unlimited property rights lead to a particular kind of theory. Libertarianism is a theory that emphasizes individual freedoms, including property rights. But libertarianism usually allows for some form of government to protect those rights, not necessarily unlimited. On the other hand, if property rights are completely unlimited without any constraints, it could lead to a deontological theory, which focuses on duties and rules. But I'm not sure how that directly ties in.

Alternatively, if unlimited property rights aren't tempered by other considerations, like social welfare or equality, it might commit one to a capitalist system, which is driven by private property and market forces. So option I is capitalism. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another thought: Wellman might argue that unlimited property rights lead to socialism because the community would need to regulate it to prevent inequality. But socialism is about collective ownership, so that seems less likely.

Egalitarianism (option F) is about equality, so if unlimited property rights create inequality, maybe Wellman argues that you're committed to a system that needs to address that, but the question is what you're committed to by insisting on unlimited rights, not the solution.

Consequentialism (H) is about the consequences of actions, so maybe not directly. Utilitarianism (G) is similar. Deontological theory (B) is about duties, which might not fit here.

Looking back, I think the key is that unlimited property rights, if enforced without constraints, would lead to a capitalist system where the market drives everything, and the government's role is minimal. So the answer might be I: capitalism.

Alternatively, some might think it leads to anarchy (A), but anarchy is more about the lack of government, not the economic system. Capitalism can exist with a government, albeit a minimal one.

So, putting it all together, I think the answer is I: capitalism.

The question asks what Wellman argues happens if one insists on unlimited property rights. After considering various options, the reasoning concludes that unlimited property rights, when taken to an extreme, can lead to a capitalist system driven by private ownership and market forces. This aligns with the idea that such a system emphasizes individual property rights without significant regulation, which can result in inequality and a capitalist structure. 

Answer: I
