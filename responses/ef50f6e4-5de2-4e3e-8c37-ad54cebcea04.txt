Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about consumer and producer surplus. Let me start by understanding the problem.

Elsa values her time at $50 per hour. So, for two hours, her opportunity cost or the minimum she'd accept is 2 * $50 = $100. She tutors David for two hours, and David is willing to pay $175 for those two hours. But they negotiate a price of $125 for the entire two hours.

I remember that consumer surplus is the difference between what the buyer is willing to pay and what they actually pay. So David was willing to pay $175 but paid $125. His consumer surplus is $175 - $125 = $50.

Producer surplus is the difference between what the seller is paid and what they were willing to accept. Elsa was willing to take $100 (since she values her time at $50/hour), and she got $125. So her producer surplus is $125 - $100 = $25.

Now, comparing the two: Consumer surplus is $50, and producer surplus is $25. So consumer surplus is greater than producer surplus by $25. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see an option that says the difference is exactly $25. Let me check the options again.

Option H says the difference is $25. That would make sense because 50 - 25 = 25. But wait, the question is about which statement is true. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake.

Wait, the options are about whether consumer surplus is greater or less, and by how much. So if consumer surplus is $50 and producer is $25, the difference is $25. So the difference is $25, which would be option H.

Wait, but let me think again. Sometimes people get confused between total surplus and the difference. Let me confirm:

Consumer surplus (CS) = Willing to pay - Actual payment = 175 - 125 = 50.

Producer surplus (PS) = Actual payment - Minimum accepted = 125 - 100 = 25.

The difference between CS and PS is 50 - 25 = 25. So the difference is $25, which matches option H.

But let me check the other options. Option H says the difference is $25. So that should be correct. But wait, I'm looking at the options again.

Option H: The difference between consumer and producer surplus is $25.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be H.

The consumer surplus is $50, and the producer surplus is $25, making the difference $25.

Answer: H
