Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what substance was used for blood in the famous shower scene from the movie 'Psycho'. I remember that in that scene, there's a lot of blood, and it's quite iconic. I think it's the one where the hotel manager's wife gets stabbed in the shower. 

I've heard before that they didn't use real blood because of health and safety reasons, or maybe because it wasn't practical. So they probably used something else that's red and can be used in a scene like that. Let me think about the options given.

The options are A: red wine, B: cranberry juice, C: tomato juice, D: red ink, E: chocolate syrup, F: raspberry jam, G: red food coloring, H: beetroot juice, I: strawberry syrup, J: ketchup.

I remember hearing that chocolate syrup was used in some old movies for blood because it's thick and doesn't dry too quickly. Wait, was that 'Psycho'? I think I'm mixing up some movies. Or was it another Hitchcock film? Hmm.

Wait, no, I think in 'Psycho', they actually used something else. I'm pretty sure it's tomato juice. Because tomato juice is red and can be made to look like blood. But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again. 

I also recall that chocolate syrup is often used because it has a thick consistency and doesn't run off too much, which might be better for a scene where blood is pooling. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe they used a mixture of things, but the primary substance was tomato juice.

Wait, another thought: I think in the shower scene, the blood looks more like it's flowing, so maybe tomato juice is better because it's more liquid. Chocolate syrup is more viscous, so it might not spread as much. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, red wine could be another option. But red wine is alcohol, and I'm not sure if that's the case. Or raspberry jam? That's thick too, but maybe less likely. 

I think I've heard that tomato juice was used. It's a common substitute for blood in films because it's readily available, red, and not too expensive. So I'm leaning towards option C: tomato juice. But I'm a bit unsure because I might be confusing it with another film. 

Wait, another angle: the director, Alfred Hitchcock, was known for being resourceful. He probably used whatever was available and practical. Tomato juice is a common substitute, so that makes sense. It's also easy to clean up, I guess. 

So putting it all together, I think the answer is C: tomato juice.
