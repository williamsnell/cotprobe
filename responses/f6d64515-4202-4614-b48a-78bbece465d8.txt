The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!
Olympe de Gouges, "Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen," 1791
The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear—but apart from that, nothing has changed.
Halima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about revolutions and gender, based on two passages. I need to figure out which observation is best supported by the first passage, which is Olympe de Gouges' "Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen" from 1791.

First, I'll read the passage carefully. It starts with a call to women to wake up and discover their rights, contrasting the strength of enslaved men who have become free but unjust to their companions, meaning women. The speaker is urging women to stop being blind and questioning what they've gained from the Revolution—more scorn and disdain. The passage then tells women to courageously oppose force with their own strength, regardless of barriers, as they can free themselves.

So, the main points here are about women's rights and the failure of the Revolution to address them adequately. The passage criticizes the Revolution for not improving women's status, suggesting that despite the gains for men, women were overlooked or even worse off.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Revolutions always improve women's status. But the passage seems to argue the opposite, that women were not benefited and perhaps even worse off. So A is probably incorrect.

B: Women rarely support revolutions and receive little benefit. The passage doesn't talk about support levels but rather about the outcomes for women. So B might not be the best fit.

C: Women are primary beneficiaries. Again, the passage shows women didn't benefit, so C is wrong.

D: Success of revolution is determined by women's rights. The passage isn't about measuring success but about the failure to address women's rights, so D might be a contender but not the best.

E: Gains are equally distributed. The passage suggests otherwise, so E is out.

F: Revolutions result in immediate gender equality. The passage is from 1791, and we know that the French Revolution didn't immediately grant women equality, so F is incorrect.

G: Revolutionary progressivism doesn't always concern itself with gender equality. This seems to fit because the passage implies that while the Revolution was progressive in other areas, it neglected women's rights, showing that progressivism isn't always inclusive of gender equality.

H: Women's rights are championed by revolutionary leaders. The passage criticizes leaders for not doing so, so H is incorrect.

I: Women assume leadership roles during revolutions. The passage doesn't mention women in leadership, so I is not supported.

So, the best answer seems to be G. The passage supports the idea that revolutionary movements, while progressive, don't always focus on or achieve gender equality. They might neglect it, as seen in the context where women's rights were overlooked.

The passage highlights the failure of the Revolution to improve women's status, suggesting that revolutionary movements may neglect gender equality despite being progressive. 

Answer: G
