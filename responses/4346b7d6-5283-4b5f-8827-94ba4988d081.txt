Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about rectal bleeding, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me go through each option one by one and think about what I know.

Starting with option A: "Hemorrhoids are never a cause of rectal bleeding." Hmm, I remember that hemorrhoids can cause rectal bleeding. They're swollen veins in the rectum or anus, and when they rupture, they can bleed, usually resulting in bright red blood. So A is probably false because hemorrhoids are a common cause.

Option B: "A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure." I think a digital exam is when a doctor inserts a finger. If it's painful, could that indicate a fissure? Anal fissures are small tears in the lining of the anus, which can cause pain and bleeding. So if the exam is painful, it might suggest a fissure. B seems plausible.

Option C: "A colonoscopy is not necessary if rectal bleeding is present." That doesn't sound right. Rectal bleeding can be due to various issues, and a colonoscopy is often used to check the entire colon and rectum for abnormalities. So C is probably false because colonoscopy is usually recommended for rectal bleeding.

Option D: "Rectal cancer is the commonest cause of rectal bleeding." I don't think so. Hemorrhoids are more common causes of rectal bleeding, as I thought earlier. So D is likely false.

Option E: "Bright red blood on the finger usually signifies a caecal lesion." Bright red blood typically comes from lower down, like the rectum or anus. A caecal lesion is in the cecum, which is part of the colon. Blood from there would probably be darker or not as bright. So E is probably false.

Option F: "Rectal bleeding is always a sign of cancer." Definitely not. As I mentioned, hemorrhoids are a common cause, and other conditions like fissures or diverticulosis can also cause it. So F is false.

Option G: "Proctoscopy is of no value in the assessment of rectal bleeding." Proctoscopy is a procedure where a scope is used to look inside the rectum. It's useful for diagnosing issues like hemorrhoids or fissures. So G is false because it is valuable.

Option H: "Rectal bleeding is not a symptom of diverticulosis." Wait, diverticulosis can cause rectal bleeding, especially if the diverticula become inflamed or bleed. So H is false.

Option I: "Rectal bleeding is always accompanied by pain." No, rectal bleeding can occur without pain. For example, with hemorrhoids, sometimes you have pain, but not always. So I is false.

Option J: "A negative colonoscopy rules out all causes of rectal bleeding." That's not true. Colonoscopy can miss some causes, like small lesions or if the bleeding is from a part not easily seen, or if it's from an upper GI source. So J is false.

So, the only statement that seems true is option B: A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure.

The correct answer is B: A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure.

Answer: B
