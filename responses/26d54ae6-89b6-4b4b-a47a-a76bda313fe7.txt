Okay, I'm trying to figure out this economics question about education and externalities. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that education makes Chris a better worker, voter, parent, and citizen. So, the benefits of education go beyond what Chris himself enjoys. That makes me think about externalities because externalities are when the benefits or costs of an action aren't just felt by the person doing it.

Externalities can be positive or negative. In this case, since education is benefiting others besides Chris, it's a positive externality. For example, if Chris is a better worker, his employer benefits. If he's a better citizen, society as a whole benefits from his contributions.

Now, looking at the options, they talk about externalities and whether something should be taxed or subsidized. Subsidies are when the government gives money to support something, and taxes are the opposite.

I remember that when there are positive externalities, the private market tends to underprovide the good because individuals don't account for the external benefits. So, the government might step in to subsidize it to increase the supply. This makes sense because without subsidies, people might not invest as much in education as they should because they only see their own costs and benefits, not the broader societal ones.

Looking at the options:

A says no externalities and shouldn't be subsidized. That's not right because there are externalities here.

B talks about decreasing marginal utility and taxing. I don't think the question is about utility but externalities.

C and G mention externalities and subsidies. Since it's a positive externality, the good should be subsidized. So, G says externalities and should be subsidized.

D says increasing marginal utility but shouldn't be subsidized. That doesn't fit because we should subsidize positive externalities.

E says externalities but should be taxed. Taxing would reduce the good, which isn't what we want here.

F says externalities but shouldn't be subsidized. Again, that's the opposite of what's needed.

H says increasing marginal utility but should be taxed. Not relevant to the externality point.

I says no externalities and should be subsidized. No, there are externalities.

J says decreasing marginal utility and shouldn't be taxed. Not applicable.

So, the correct answer must be G: externalities and should be subsidized.

The correct answer is G: externalities and should be subsidized.
