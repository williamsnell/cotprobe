Question:

Cooper is suing March for money damages. Because he believes portions of March's deposition are highly favorable to his case, Cooper's attorney intends to read parts of the deposition at trial instead of calling March to the stand. March objects to Cooper's use of the deposition at trial. What is the court's likely ruling?

Options:

A: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but only if he can prove that March's statements are unreliable.
B: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but only if March's attorney is present during the reading.
C: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as it is considered hearsay.
D: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as this would make March his witness and immune to impeachment.
E: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but must read the entire deposition, not just selected parts.
F: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as it would violate March's right to confrontation.
G: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but only to contradict or impeach March's prior inconsistent statements or pleadings.
H: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but, if requested, he must read all parts that in fairness ought to be considered with the part introduced.
I: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, unless March is unavailable to testify.
J: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as March is able to testify and no exceptional circumstances exist.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about depositions being used at trial. Let me break it down step by step. 

The question says that Cooper is suing March for money damages. Cooper's attorney wants to read parts of March's deposition during the trial instead of calling March as a witness. March objects to this. The question is about the court's likely ruling.

First, I need to remember the rules about using depositions at trial. I recall that depositions are statements made under oath outside of court, usually during the discovery phase. They can be used in certain situations during a trial.

I think about the hearsay rule. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Generally, hearsay is inadmissible unless there's an exception. So, if Cooper is using March's deposition to prove the truth of what March said, that would be hearsay unless an exception applies.

One exception is the "former testimony" exception. But for that, the witness must have been unavailable at the time of trial. If March is available to testify, then using the deposition might be problematic because the court prefers live testimony.

Another point is about the right to confrontation. The Confrontation Clause in the Constitution allows a defendant to confront the witness against them. But this mainly applies to criminal cases, I think. In civil cases, the rules might be different. However, if March is available, the court might prefer that he testify live so his credibility can be assessed through cross-examination.

Wait, but in some cases, even if a witness is available, using their deposition might be allowed if it's for a specific purpose, like impeachment. But the question says Cooper wants to read parts that are favorable to his case, so it's not just for impeachment.

I also remember something about the "voucher" rule. If you use a deposition, you might make the deponent your own witness, which means you can't impeach them with other statements. But in this case, Cooper isn't calling March as a witness; he's just using the deposition. So maybe that rule doesn't apply here.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Cooper may use the deposition if he proves the statements are unreliable. That doesn't sound right because the issue is whether it's hearsay or not, not the reliability.

Option B: Must have March's attorney present. I don't think that's a requirement for using a deposition unless there's a specific rule about it, which I don't recall.

Option C: It's hearsay, so Cooper can't use it. That makes sense because without an exception, using the deposition to prove the truth would be inadmissible.

Option D: Using the deposition makes March a witness and immune to impeachment. Wait, if Cooper uses the deposition, he's effectively making March a witness. But if March is a witness, he can be impeached. So this option might not be correct because the court wouldn't allow that.

Option E: Must read the entire deposition. No, you can usually use selected parts as long as they're not taken out of context.

Option F: Violates confrontation right. In criminal cases, but in civil, this might not apply. However, some states have extended confrontation issues to civil cases, but I'm not sure.

Option G: Use deposition to contradict prior inconsistent statements. That's an exception under the hearsay rule, but only if the statements are offered for impeachment, not for the truth.

Option H: Must read all parts that should be considered fairly. This sounds like a rule about completeness, but the question is about admissibility, not about what parts to include.

Option I: Not allowed unless March is unavailable. That seems correct because if March is available, using the deposition might not be permitted unless it's under an exception.

Option J: Not allowed because March can testify and no exceptional circumstances. This seems similar to I but more specific. So if March is available, you can't use the deposition unless there's a reason.

Wait, so the key here is whether March is available. If March is available, the deposition can't be used unless there's an exception. The main exceptions are for unavailable witnesses. So if March is available, Cooper can't use the deposition unless it's for impeachment or another allowed purpose.

But in the question, Cooper is using it because it's favorable, so it's being offered for the truth. Without an exception, it's hearsay. So the likely ruling would be that Cooper can't use the deposition because March is available.

Looking back at the options, option J says Cooper may not use the deposition because March is able to testify and no exceptional circumstances exist. That seems to fit because if the witness is available, the deposition isn't admissible unless under specific exceptions, which don't seem to apply here.

Alternatively, option C says it's hearsay. That's also correct. So which one is more accurate?

I think the main issue is the availability of the witness. The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 804 allows depositions to be used if the witness is unavailable. But if the witness is available, then under FRE 612, you can use a deposition to contradict the witness's testimony at trial, but that's for impeachment, not for the truth.

So in this case, Cooper is trying to use the deposition for the truth of the matter, which would be hearsay. So the correct ruling would be that it's inadmissible as hearsay (option C). But another angle is that since March is available, the deposition can't be used unless for impeachment, which isn't what's happening here. So option J might also be correct.

Wait, but the question is about whether Cooper can use the deposition at all. So if March is available, the deposition can't be used unless under an exception. Since Cooper is using it to prove his case, it's hearsay without an exception, making it inadmissible. So option C is correct.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes in civil cases, the rules around depositions being used when the witness is available can vary. But I think the general rule is that if the witness is available, their deposition can't be used unless for impeachment purposes.

Wait, another thought: There's also the concept of "voucher" when using a deposition. If you use a deposition, you take on the burden of producing the witness, making them your own witness. But in this case, Cooper isn't calling March as a witness, just using the deposition. So maybe that rule doesn't apply here.

I think the main issue is hearsay. The deposition is being offered to prove the truth of the matter, which is hearsay unless an exception applies. Since March is available, there's no exception like former testimony. So the deposition is inadmissible as hearsay. Therefore, the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, another angle: In some jurisdictions, depositions can be used as substantive evidence if the opposing party has had a chance to examine the witness. That's under FRE 32(a)(4), which allows depositions to be used as evidence if the opposing party had an opportunity to examine the deponent and the deponent is unavailable. But if the deponent is available, that section doesn't apply. So without that, it's hearsay.

So yes, the court would likely rule that Cooper can't use the deposition because it's hearsay unless an exception applies, which it doesn't here.

The question revolves around whether Cooper can use portions of March's deposition at trial for their truth, given that March is available to testify. The key issue is whether the deposition qualifies as hearsay and whether an exception applies.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and generally, it is inadmissible unless an exception applies. One such exception is the "former testimony" exception under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 804(a)(1), which allows the use of prior testimony if the witness is unavailable. However, since March is available to testify, this exception does not apply.

Additionally, under FRE 32(a)(4), depositions can be used as substantive evidence if the opposing party had an opportunity to examine the witness and the witness is unavailable. Since March is available, this rule does not permit the use of the deposition as substantive evidence.

Cooper's attorney intends to use the deposition for its truth, which would constitute hearsay without an applicable exception. Therefore, the court is likely to rule that the deposition cannot be used at trial because it is hearsay.
