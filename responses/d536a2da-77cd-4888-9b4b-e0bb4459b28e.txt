Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the gravitational force between two spheres in a Cavendish balance. Hmm, I remember that the Cavendish balance is used to measure the gravitational constant, but I'm not too familiar with the exact setup. Anyway, let's focus on the problem.

The question gives me two masses: m is 1 gram and m' is 500 grams. The distance between them, r, is 5 centimeters. I need to find the gravitational force between them. The answer options are all in dynes, which is the CGS unit of force.

Wait, I should recall Newton's law of universal gravitation. The formula is F = G*(m1*m2)/r². But wait, what's G in CGS units? I think in SI units, G is approximately 6.674×10^-11 N·m²/kg². But since we're dealing with grams and centimeters, I need to convert everything to the correct units or use G in CGS.

Alternatively, I remember that in CGS units, G is approximately 6.67×10^-8 cm³/(g·s²). Wait, let me check that. Oh right, because 1 N is 10^5 dynes, and 1 kg is 1000 grams, so when converting units, the G in CGS units would be scaled accordingly. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to convert the masses and distance to kilograms and meters and use SI units, then convert the result to dynes.

Let me think. Let's try both approaches to see which is easier.

First approach: Using CGS units directly.

Masses: m = 1 gram, m' = 500 grams. So m1 = 1 g, m2 = 500 g.

Distance r = 5 cm.

So in CGS units, G is 6.67×10^-8 cm³/(g·s²). So plugging into F = G*(m1*m2)/r².

Wait, but wait: F would be in dynes because in CGS, the unit of force is dyne. Let me make sure.

Yes, because in CGS, F in dynes, masses in grams, distance in cm, and G is cm³/(g·s²), so when you multiply G by grams squared and divide by cm squared, the units would be cm³/(g·s²) * (g²)/(cm²) = (g·cm)/s². Wait, but 1 dyne is 1 g·cm/s². So yes, the units work out.

So F = 6.67e-8 cm³/(g·s²) * (1 g * 500 g) / (5 cm)^2.

Calculating the numerator: 1 * 500 = 500 g².

Denominator: (5 cm)^2 = 25 cm².

So F = (6.67e-8 cm³/(g·s²)) * (500 g²) / (25 cm²).

Simplify the numbers: 500 /25 = 20.

So F = 6.67e-8 * 20.

6.67 times 20 is 133.4, so 133.4e-8 = 1.334e-6 dyne.

Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 1.33 ×10^-6 dyne. That's close, but wait, did I compute correctly?

Wait, let's double-check the calculation.

Wait, 6.67e-8 multiplied by 20: 6.67 *20 is 133.4, so 133.4e-8 is 1.334e-6 dyne. So approximately 1.334e-6, which rounds to 1.33e-6, so option B.

Alternatively, let me consider the SI unit approach to confirm.

Convert masses to kg: 1g = 0.001 kg, 500g = 0.5 kg.

Convert distance to meters: 5 cm = 0.05 m.

G in SI is 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg².

F = G*(m1*m2)/r² = 6.674e-11 * 0.001 kg * 0.5 kg / (0.05 m)^2.

Compute numerator: 0.001 * 0.5 = 0.0005 kg².

Denominator: (0.05)^2 = 0.0025 m².

So F = 6.674e-11 * 0.0005 / 0.0025.

Compute 0.0005 / 0.0025 = 0.2.

So F = 6.674e-11 * 0.2 = 1.3348e-11 N.

Now, convert Newtons to dynes. Since 1 N = 10^5 dyne, so 1.3348e-11 N * 1e5 dyne/N = 1.3348e-6 dyne.

Again, same result: approximately 1.33e-6 dyne, so option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 1.33 ×10^-6 dyne. So that's the correct answer.

The gravitational force between the two spheres is calculated using Newton's law of universal gravitation. Converting all units to CGS or SI and applying the formula yields a result of approximately \(1.33 \times 10^{-6}\) dyne.
