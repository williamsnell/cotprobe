Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the financing charge for a stove purchase. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

Alright, the stove costs $250, and the installment plan requires a $25 down payment. Then, there are 12 monthly payments of $20 each. I need to find out what the financing charge is. 

First, I think I should calculate the total amount paid under the installment plan. The down payment is $25, and then each month you pay $20 for 12 months. So the total payments would be 25 plus (20 times 12). Let me do that math: 20 times 12 is 240, and adding the down payment gives 25 + 240 = 265. 

Wait, so the total amount paid is $265. The stove was $250, so the extra amount must be the financing charge. How do I calculate that? I think it's the total paid minus the original price. So 265 minus 250 equals 15. Hmm, so the financing charge is $15. 

Looking at the options, I see option I is $15. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check. Did I add everything correctly? 12 times 20 is 240, plus 25 makes 265. Yes, that's right. 265 minus 250 is definitely 15. Yeah, I'm confident now.

The total amount paid is $25 (down payment) + $20/month × 12 months = $265. The original price is $250, so the financing charge is $265 − $250 = $15.
