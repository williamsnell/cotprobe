Question:

Six positive integers are written on the faces of a cube. Each vertex is labeled with the product of the three numbers on the faces adjacent to the vertex. If the sum of the numbers on the vertices is equal to $1001$, then what is the sum of the numbers written on the faces?

C: 15
D: 20
E: 13
F: 18
G: 27

Okay, so I have this problem where there are six positive integers written on the faces of a cube. Each vertex is labeled with the product of the three numbers on the adjacent faces. The sum of all these vertex numbers is 1001, and I need to find the sum of the numbers on the faces. The options are from A to J, with numbers like 36, 31, etc.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that a cube has 8 vertices and 6 faces. Each face is adjacent to four vertices, right? Because each face is a square, and each edge of the square is shared with another face.

Wait, but each vertex is where three faces meet. So, for each vertex, the product is of the three numbers on those adjacent faces. So if I denote the numbers on the faces as a, b, c, d, e, f, then each vertex product would be something like a*b*c, but wait, no, that's not right because each face is opposite another face. Maybe I should think of the cube as having opposite faces.

Let me visualize a cube. Let's say the top face is a, bottom face is b, front face is c, back face is d, left face is e, and right face is f. So each vertex is the intersection of three adjacent faces. For example, the top-front-left vertex would be a * c * e. Similarly, the top-front-right would be a * c * f, top-back-left is a * d * e, and so on.

Wait, but if I list all eight vertices, each product will involve three variables. But maybe there's a pattern or a formula here. I seem to recall that the sum of all vertex products can be expressed in terms of the face numbers in a particular way.

Wait, maybe it's the product of (a + b) * (c + d) * (e + f). Because each pair of opposite faces (a and b, c and d, e and f) contributes to the sum when multiplied together, considering all combinations.

Let me check that. So, (a + b) is the sum of top and bottom, (c + d) is front and back, (e + f) is left and right. If I multiply these together, I get all possible products of one face from each pair. That would include all eight possible combinations, which correspond to the eight vertices. So the sum of the vertex products would indeed be (a + b)(c + d)(e + f).

Wait, that makes sense. Because each vertex product is a combination of one face from top/bottom, one from front/back, and one from left/right. So when you expand (a + b)(c + d)(e + f), you get all possible products, which are the vertex products. So the sum of the vertices is (a + b)(c + d)(e + f) = 1001.

So the problem reduces to finding (a + b)(c + d)(e + f) = 1001, and then the sum of the face numbers is (a + b + c + d + e + f). But since (a + b) = x, (c + d) = y, (e + f) = z, then the sum of the face numbers is x + y + z, and the product xyz = 1001.

So now, I need to find x, y, z such that xyz = 1001, and x, y, z are positive integers because each face has a positive integer. Then, the sum of the face numbers is x + y + z.

So first, let's factorize 1001 to find possible values for x, y, z.

1001 is a well-known number. Let me see: 1001 ÷ 7 = 143. Then, 143 ÷ 11 = 13. So 1001 = 7 × 11 × 13. These are all primes, so the factors are 1, 7, 11, 13, 77, 91, 143, 1001.

So the possible triplet (x, y, z) could be (7, 11, 13) in some order because 7 × 11 × 13 = 1001. Alternatively, one of them could be 1, but that would make one of the face pairs sum to 1, which is possible only if both faces are 1 each. But let's check if that's necessary.

Wait, but if any of x, y, or z is 1, say x=1, then (a + b)=1. Since a and b are positive integers, the only possibility is a=1 and b=0, but b has to be positive, so that's impossible. So x, y, z must all be greater than 1. So the triplet (7, 11, 13) is the only possible one where each is greater than 1 and their product is 1001.

So x + y + z = 7 + 11 + 13 = 31. So the sum of the face numbers is 31, which is option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other triplet. For example, could I have (1, 7, 143)? Well, 1 × 7 × 143 = 1001, but as I thought earlier, 1 would require one face pair to sum to 1, which isn't possible because both faces are positive integers. So the only valid triplet is (7, 11, 13). So the sum is 31, which is option B.

The problem involves six positive integers on a cube's faces, with each vertex labeled as the product of three adjacent faces. The sum of these vertex products is 1001, and we need to find the sum of the face numbers.

Each vertex product corresponds to a combination of one face from each pair of opposite faces (top/bottom, front/back, left/right). The sum of all vertex products is the product of the sums of these opposite face pairs: \((a + b)(c + d)(e + f)\), which equals 1001. 

Factoring 1001 gives \(7 \times 11 \times 13\), so the sums of the opposite face pairs must be 7, 11, and 13. The sum of the face numbers is the sum of these values: \(7 + 11 + 13 = 31\).

Thus, the sum of the numbers on the faces is **31**.
