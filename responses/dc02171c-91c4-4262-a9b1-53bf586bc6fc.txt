Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me see what it's about. The question is about the chemical potentials of water and ethanol in a mixture. Hmm, I remember that chemical potential is a concept related to the thermodynamics of solutions. 

The problem states that a mixture of water and ethanol has a mole fraction of water of 0.60. Then, a small change in the mixture composition causes the chemical potential of water to increase by 0.25 J/mol. I need to find by how much the chemical potential of ethanol changes. 

I think I remember that in a binary mixture, the changes in chemical potentials of the two components are related in a specific way. Oh right, there's a principle that the sum of the changes in chemical potentials is zero. Or wait, is it that the change in chemical potential of one component is the negative of the other? Let me think. 

In an ideal solution, the chemical potential of each component is given by μ_i = μ_i^* + RT ln X_i, where X_i is the mole fraction, and μ_i^* is the standard chemical potential. When the composition changes, the mole fractions change, and so do the chemical potentials. 

But when considering a small change, the changes in chemical potential are related. So if the change in μ_water is Δμ_water, then the change in μ_ethanol should be Δμ_ethanol = -Δμ_water? Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Because the sum of the partial molar changes... Wait, maybe I should think in terms of exact differentials. 

The Gibbs-Duhem equation comes into play here. The Gibbs-Duhem equation relates the changes in chemical potentials of the components in a mixture. For a binary mixture, it states that S dμ1 + (1 - S) dμ2 = 0, where S is the mole fraction of component 1, and the other component is 2. 

In this case, component 1 is water, with mole fraction S = 0.60, and component 2 is ethanol. So the equation becomes 0.60 dμ_water + (1 - 0.60) dμ_ethanol = 0. Simplifying, 0.60 dμ_water + 0.40 dμ_ethanol = 0. 

We know that dμ_water is 0.25 J/mol. Plugging that in: 0.60 * 0.25 + 0.40 * dμ_ethanol = 0. So 0.15 + 0.40 * dμ_ethanol = 0. Solving for dμ_ethanol: 0.40 * dμ_ethanol = -0.15 → dμ_ethanol = -0.15 / 0.40 = -0.375 J/mol. 

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see exactly -0.375. Let me check the options again. Option I is -0.38 J/mol, which is close. So that would be approximately -0.38 J/mol. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the math. 0.60 * 0.25 is 0.15. So 0.15 + 0.40 * x = 0 → 0.40 x = -0.15 → x = -0.15 / 0.40 = -0.375. Yeah, that's correct. So the change in ethanol's chemical potential is approximately -0.38 J/mol. 

Looking back at the options, option I is -0.38, so that's the answer. Alternatively, if I consider significant figures, perhaps the answer is -0.38, which is option I.

The problem involves a binary mixture of water and ethanol where the mole fraction of water is 0.60. A small change in composition increases the chemical potential of water by 0.25 J/mol. Using the Gibbs-Duhem equation for a binary mixture, the changes in chemical potentials of the two components are related. For water (S = 0.60) and ethanol, the equation is:

\[ 0.60 \cdot \Delta\mu_{\text{water}} + 0.40 \cdot \Delta\mu_{\text{ethanol}} = 0 \]

Substituting \(\Delta\mu_{\text{water}} = 0.25 \, \mathrm{J/mol}\):

\[ 0.60 \cdot 0.25 + 0.40 \cdot \Delta\mu_{\text{ethanol}} = 0 \]

\[ 0.15 + 0.40 \cdot \Delta\mu_{\text{ethanol}} = 0 \]

Solving for \(\Delta\mu_{\text{ethanol}}\):

\[ 0.40 \cdot \Delta\mu_{\text{ethanol}} = -0.15 \]

\[ \Delta\mu_{\text{ethanol}} = -\frac{0.15}{0.40} = -0.375 \, \mathrm{J/mol} \]

Approximating to two decimal places, \(\Delta\mu_{\text{ethanol}} \approx -0.38 \, \mathrm{J/mol}\). Among the options, the closest match is **I: -0.38 J/mol**.
