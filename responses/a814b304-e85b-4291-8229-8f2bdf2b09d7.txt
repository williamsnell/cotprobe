Okay, so I have this problem about a convex 3D object. It has 15 vertices and 39 edges, and I need to find out how many faces it has. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the right one. Hmm, I remember something about Euler's formula from my geometry class. Let me think about that.

Euler's formula relates the number of vertices (V), edges (E), and faces (F) of a convex polyhedron. The formula is V - E + F = 2. Right, so if I can plug in the values I have into this formula, I should be able to solve for F, the number of faces.

So the given values are V = 15 and E = 39. Let me write down the formula:

V - E + F = 2

Plugging in the numbers:

15 - 39 + F = 2

Let me do the math step by step. 15 minus 39 is... that's -24, right? So:

-24 + F = 2

Now I need to solve for F. I'll add 24 to both sides of the equation:

F = 2 + 24
F = 26

Wait, so F is 26? Let me double-check my calculations. 15 minus 39 is indeed -24. Then adding F gives -24 + F = 2. Adding 24 to both sides gives F = 26. That seems right.

Looking back at the options, option B is 26. So that must be the correct answer. I don't think I made a mistake here. Euler's formula is pretty straightforward, and the numbers fit. I guess the object has 26 faces.

The correct answer is B: 26.
