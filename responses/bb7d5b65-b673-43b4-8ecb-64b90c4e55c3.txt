Okay, so I've got this Python expression to evaluate: 4 + 3 % 2. Hmm, I remember that in Python, the order of operations is important. Let me think... Oh right, it's parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and then addition and subtraction. But wait, there's also the modulus operator which is like division's remainder. 

So the expression is 4 plus (3 mod 2). Let me break it down. The modulus part comes first because of operator precedence. 3 % 2 is equal to 1, right? Because 2 goes into 3 once with a remainder of 1. So then the expression simplifies to 4 + 1. That adds up to 5. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the order. Oh, no, because in Python, the modulus has higher precedence than addition, so I definitely compute 3%2 first. So 3 mod 2 is 1, then add that to 4. Yep, 4 + 1 is 5. Looking at the options, J is 5. So the answer should be J.

The expression evaluates to 5. 

Answer: J
