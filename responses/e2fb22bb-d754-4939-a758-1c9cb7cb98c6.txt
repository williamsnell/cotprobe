Okay, so I have this question about the slippery-slope argument fallacy. I need to figure out when it's fallacious. Let me start by recalling what a slippery-slope argument is. From what I remember, it's when someone argues that a small initial action will lead to a series of similar actions, eventually resulting in a significant negative outcome. Like, "If we let the kids stay up late, they'll never go to bed at all!"

Now, the question is asking when this pattern is fallacious. Fallacious means it's a logical fallacy, so it's when the argument is flawed or incorrect.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the scenario where the slippery-slope argument is wrong. Let's go through each option.

Option A: There is good reason to think that doing one action will inevitably lead to another undesirable action. Hmm, wait. If there's a good reason, then the argument isn't fallacious, right? Because it's based on solid reasoning. So A might be when the argument is valid, not fallacious.

Option B: It is based on a logical progression. Logical progression sounds like a good thing. If each step follows logically, then it's not a fallacy. So B is probably not the answer.

Option C: There are more than two possible results. I'm not sure. If there are multiple possible outcomes, does that make the slippery-slope fallacious? Maybe, because the argument is assuming a specific chain without considering alternatives. But I'm not certain yet.

Option D: It is based on a series of cause and effect situations. Cause and effect is a valid reasoning, so if the argument correctly follows cause and effect, it's not a fallacy. So D isn't the right choice.

Option E: It is grounded in established facts. Established facts would support a valid argument, so E isn't the fallacious case.

Option F: It is based on a hypothetical situation. Hypotheticals can be part of slippery slopes, but being hypothetical doesn't necessarily make it fallacious. It depends on the reasoning.

Option G: There is no good reason to think that doing one action will inevitably lead to another undesirable action. Oh, this sounds like the fallacy. If there's no solid reason to believe the chain will happen, then the argument is flawed. So G might be the correct answer.

Option H: There are only two possible results. If it's a binary outcome, maybe that's restrictive, but I'm not sure how this directly relates to the fallacy. The key issue is whether the chain is justified.

Option I: There is a significant amount of evidence supporting the pattern. Evidence would make the argument stronger, so I isn't fallacious.

Option J: It is hypothetical. Similar to F, being hypothetical isn't necessarily a fallacy unless it's not supported.

So putting it together, the slippery-slope argument is fallacious when there's no good reason to believe the chain of events will happen. That would be option G. Because if the connection isn't justified, the argument is just a baseless fear, hence a fallacy.

The slippery-slope argument is fallacious when there is no good reason to think that doing one action will inevitably lead to another undesirable action, as it relies on an unsupported chain of events.

Answer: G
