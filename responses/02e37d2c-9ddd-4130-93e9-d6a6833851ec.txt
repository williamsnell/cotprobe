Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because buffer solutions can be a bit tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that the ionization constant (Ka) of lactic acid at 25°C is 1.4 × 10^-4. A buffer solution is made by adding 1.00 mole of lactic acid and 0.80 mole of sodium lactate to 1 kg of water. Then there are three parts to the question: (a) find the pH, (b) find the pH change when adding 0.50 mole of NaOH, and (c) find the pH change when adding 0.50 mole of NaOH to 1 kg of pure water. The options are given from A to J.

First, I'll tackle part (a). I remember that for buffer solutions, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is useful. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]), where [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.

Wait, but the question mentions activity coefficients. Oh right, because ions in solution have activities less than their concentrations due to the ionic strength. The activity coefficient here is given as 0.65 for each univalent ion. Hmm, so I need to adjust the concentrations using this activity coefficient.

Wait, but wait. Lactic acid is a weak acid, HA, and sodium lactate is A- (the conjugate base). So when I calculate [A-] and [HA], I need to consider their actual concentrations in the solution, then adjust their activities using the activity coefficient.

Wait, but I think in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, when using activities, the equation becomes pH = pKa + log (a_A-/a_HA), where a is the activity. Since both A- and HA are present, but wait, HA is a weak acid and doesn't dissociate much, so its activity coefficient would be close to 1? Or does it also have an activity coefficient?

Wait, the problem says that the activity coefficient of each univalent ion is 0.65. So, for A-, which is a -1 charge, the activity is 0.65 times the concentration. But what about HA? Since it's a neutral molecule, its activity coefficient is 1, right? Because activity coefficients are for ions. So, in the Henderson equation, the activities would be [A-] * γ_A- and [HA] * γ_HA.

But wait, γ_HA is 1 because it's a neutral species, so the equation becomes pH = pKa + log([A-]γ_A-/ [HA]γ_HA) → pH = pKa + log([A-] * 0.65 / [HA]).

Alternatively, I might have to consider the activities more carefully. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentrations are adjusted using the activity coefficients. So, when calculating [A-] and [HA], their activities would be [A-] * γ and [HA] * γ_HA. Since HA is neutral, γ_HA is 1. So, in the Henderson equation, pH = pKa + log ( (γ_A- [A-]) / (γ_HA [HA]) ). Since γ_HA is 1, and γ_A- is 0.65, it becomes pH = pKa + log(0.65 [A-]/[HA]).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the activity of A- is [A-] multiplied by γ, and the activity of HA is [HA] multiplied by 1. Thus, in the equation, it's log(a_A-/a_HA) = log( [A-]γ / [HA] ). So yes, that's correct.

So, first, I need to find the concentrations of HA and A- in the solution. The solution is made by adding 1.00 mole HA and 0.80 mole A- to 1 kg of water. Assuming that the volume is approximately 1 kg (since water's density is about 1 kg/L), the concentrations would be:

[HA] = 1.00 mol / 1 L = 1.00 M
[A-] = 0.80 mol / 1 L = 0.80 M

But wait, wait. Wait, actually, when you mix 1 mole of HA and 0.8 mole of A-, the total volume is 1 kg (1000 mL), so it's approximately 1 L. So yes, concentrations are 1.00 M and 0.80 M.

Now, applying the Henderson equation with activity:

pH = pKa + log( ( [A-] * γ_A- ) / [HA] )

Ka is 1.4e-4, so pKa is log(1/(1.4e-4)) → let me calculate that. pKa = -log(1.4e-4) → log(1.4) is about 0.146, so 4 - 0.146 = 3.854. So pKa ≈ 3.854.

Now, [A-] is 0.80 M, γ_A- is 0.65. [HA] is 1.00 M, γ_HA is 1.

So, log( (0.80 * 0.65) / 1.00 ) → 0.80 * 0.65 = 0.52. So log(0.52) ≈ -0.283.

So pH = 3.854 + (-0.283) ≈ 3.571. So about 3.57.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. The options for part (a) are: A:3.47, B:4.17, C:3.87, D:2.87, E:3.07, F:4.57, G:3.57, H:4.07, I:3.67, J:2.57.

So 3.57 is option G's first value, which is 3.57. But wait, I'm not sure if I did the activity correctly. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the activity consideration. Let me think again. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in terms of activities is pH = pKa + log( (a_A-)/(a_HA) )

a_A- = [A-] * γ_A- = 0.80 * 0.65 = 0.52
a_HA = [HA] * γ_HA = 1.00 * 1 = 1.00

So log(0.52 / 1) = log(0.52) ≈ -0.283. So pH = 3.854 -0.283 ≈ 3.571, which is around 3.57. So option G's first part is 3.57. But wait, looking at the options, the first part of option C is 3.87, which is higher. Hmm. Did I do something wrong here?

Wait another thought: perhaps I should not adjust the concentrations but the activities. Alternatively, perhaps the activity coefficients are only applied to the ions, and the HA is neutral, so its activity is just [HA]. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the actual concentrations without adjusting for activity in the Henderson equation and then correct the pH using the activity coefficients. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the concentrations and then adjust for activity. Wait, no, because the Henderson equation uses activities, not concentrations. So the correct approach is to use the activity in the equation.

Wait, but let me think again: the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log( [base]/[acid] ), but when using activities, it becomes pH = pKa + log( (a_base)/(a_acid) ). So a_base = [base] * γ_base, a_acid = [acid] * γ_acid.

In this case, [base] is A-, which is 0.80 M, γ_base is 0.65. [acid] is HA, 1.00 M, γ_acid is 1. So the ratio is (0.80 * 0.65)/1.00 = 0.52, as before.

So pH = 3.854 + log(0.52) ≈ 3.854 - 0.283 ≈ 3.571. So the pH is approximately 3.57, which matches option G's first value.

Wait, but option G's first value is 3.57, so that's a possible candidate. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the activity coefficients are applied to the H+ concentration as well, but I think in the Henderson equation, it's only the base and acid activities that matter.

Wait, perhaps I should also consider the activity of H+ when calculating pH. Wait, no, the Henderson equation gives pH in terms of the activities of the acid and its conjugate base. So I think my approach is correct.

So part (a) answer is 3.57, which matches option G's first value. But let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option G is 3.57, 4.07, 13.512. So part (a) is 3.57, which is option G.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake with the pKa calculation. Ka is 1.4 ×10^-4, so pKa is -log(1.4e-4). Let me compute that accurately.

Log(1.4) is approximately 0.1461. So 1.4e-4 is 10^-4 * 1.4, so log is -4 + 0.1461 = -3.8539. So pKa is 3.8539, which I approximated as 3.854. So that's correct.

So part (a) is 3.57, which is option G's first value.

Now moving to part (b): find the change in pH when 0.50 mole of NaOH is added to the solution. NaOH is a strong base, so it will react with the weak acid (HA) in the buffer.

The reaction is: OH- + HA → A- + H2O.

Initially, we have 1.00 mole HA and 0.80 mole A-. When adding 0.50 mole OH-, it will react with HA to produce 0.50 mole more A- and consume 0.50 mole HA.

So after reaction:

HA: 1.00 - 0.50 = 0.50 mole
A-: 0.80 + 0.50 = 1.30 mole

But wait, wait. Wait, because the solution is 1 kg H2O, which is about 1 L, so the concentrations would be:

[HA] = 0.50 M
[A-] = 1.30 M

Again, considering activities:

pH = pKa + log( ( [A-] * γ_A- ) / [HA] )

So plugging in the numbers:

[A-] = 1.30, γ_A- = 0.65 → 1.30 * 0.65 = 0.845
[HA] = 0.50, γ_HA = 1 → 0.50 * 1 = 0.50

So the ratio is 0.845 / 0.50 = 1.69.

Log(1.69) is approximately 0.229.

So pH = 3.854 + 0.229 ≈ 4.083.

So the new pH is about 4.08. The change in pH is 4.08 - 3.57 ≈ +0.51. Wait, but I think I should calculate the exact pH and then find the change.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let's see:

pH after adding NaOH: 3.854 + log( (1.30 * 0.65) / 0.50 ) → compute 1.30 * 0.65 = 0.845, divided by 0.50 is 1.69.

Log(1.69) = 0.229.

So pH = 3.854 + 0.229 ≈ 4.083. So the pH increases by about 4.083 - 3.571 ≈ 0.512.

So the change is +0.51. Wait, but let me check the options. Looking at option G, part (b) is 4.07, which is close to 4.08. So the new pH would be approximately 4.07, and the change would be 4.07 - 3.57 = 0.50. So the change is +0.50.

Wait, but the options for part (b) are: option G's second value is 4.07, which would be the new pH. So the change is 4.07 - 3.57 = 0.50. So part (b) is +0.50 pH units.

Now part (c): find the change in pH when 0.50 mole of NaOH is added to 1 kg of pure water. So initially, pure water is 1 kg (1 L), so 1000 mL. The water is neutral, pH 7.0, but let's confirm.

When adding 0.50 mole NaOH to 1 kg water, the NaOH will dissociate completely into Na+ and OH-.

The concentration of OH- is 0.50 mol / 1 L = 0.50 M.

But wait, activity coefficients come into play here. The OH- ion has a charge of -1, so its activity is [OH-] * γ. γ is given as 0.65 for univalent ions.

So activity of OH- is 0.50 * 0.65 = 0.325.

pOH is calculated using -log(a_OH-). Wait, but wait: the activity of OH- is 0.325, so pOH = -log(0.325) ≈ 0.483.

Then pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 0.483 ≈ 13.517.

So the pH is approximately 13.52. The change from pure water (pH 7) is 13.52 - 7 = +6.52. Wait, but wait, pure water at 25°C has pH 7, but when you add a strong base like NaOH, the pH increases.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. [OH-] is 0.50 M, activity is 0.50 * 0.65 = 0.325.

pOH = -log(0.325) → log(0.325) is about -0.483. So pOH is 0.483, pH is 14 - 0.483 = 13.517.

So the pH after adding NaOH is approximately 13.52, and the change is 13.52 - 7 = +6.52.

Looking at the options, option G's third value is 13.512, which is close to 13.52. So the change would be 13.512 -7 ≈6.512.

So for part (c), the change is +6.51, which matches option G's third value, 13.512.

Wait, but wait: the initial solution in part (c) is 1 kg of pure water. When adding 0.50 mole NaOH, the volume might change slightly, but the problem says to assume 1 kg of water, so volume is taken as 1 L.

So putting it all together, the answers are:

(a) 3.57

(b) 4.07 (change from 3.57 to 4.07, so +0.50)

(c) 13.512 (change from 7 to 13.512, so +6.512)

Looking at the options, option G is (3.57, 4.07, 13.512), which matches all three parts.

So the correct answer is option G.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the pH of a buffer solution and determining the pH changes upon adding NaOH. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with activity coefficients, the pH of the buffer solution is found to be approximately 3.57. When 0.50 moles of NaOH are added, the pH increases to about 4.07. For the third part, adding 0.50 moles of NaOH to pure water results in a pH of approximately 13.512. These values correspond to option G.
