Okay, so I've got this bond problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the bond is a 15-year, $1000 bond that pays $25 every six months. The market interest rate is 4%. I need to find the fair market value of this bond. Hmm, I remember that bonds are priced based on their present value of future cash flows. So I think I need to calculate the present value of all the coupon payments and the face value at maturity.

Wait, the bond pays $25 every six months. That means it's a semi-annual coupon bond. So the interest rate would be adjusted accordingly. Since the market rate is 4% annually, the semi-annual rate would be half of that, which is 2% per period, right?

Let me jot down the details:

- Face value (FV) = $1000
- Coupon payment per period (C) = $25
- Number of periods (n) = 15 years * 2 = 30 periods
- Semi-annual market rate (r) = 4% / 2 = 2% or 0.02

I think the formula for the bond price is the present value of the coupon payments plus the present value of the face value. So the formula should be:

Bond Price = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r + FV / (1 + r)^n

Let me plug the numbers in step by step.

First, calculate the present value of the coupons. The sum of the coupons is an annuity, so I can use the present value of an annuity formula. 

PV_coupons = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

Plugging in the numbers:

PV_coupons = 25 * [1 - (1.02)^-30] / 0.02

I need to calculate (1.02)^-30. Let me think, 1.02 to the power of -30 is the same as 1 divided by (1.02)^30. I don't remember the exact value, but maybe I can estimate it. Alternatively, I can use the rule of 72 to estimate how much it compounds, but that's probably not precise enough.

Wait, I think the exact value is better. Let me try to compute (1.02)^30. I know that (1.02)^10 is approximately 1.21899. So (1.02)^30 would be (1.21899)^3. Let me compute that:

1.21899^3 ≈ 1.21899 * 1.21899 = about 1.484, then multiply by 1.21899 again. That's roughly 1.484 * 1.21899 ≈ 1.806. So (1.02)^30 ≈ 1.806. Therefore, (1.02)^-30 ≈ 1/1.806 ≈ 0.5535.

So the numerator inside the brackets becomes [1 - 0.5535] = 0.4465.

Now, PV_coupons = 25 * (0.4465 / 0.02) = 25 * (22.325) ≈ 25 * 22.325 = 558.125.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because 25 * 22 is 550, so 558 seems okay. Hmm.

Next, the present value of the face value is FV / (1 + r)^n. So:

PV_face = 1000 / (1.02)^30 ≈ 1000 / 1.806 ≈ 553.50.

Wait, that can't be right because 558 (coupons) + 553 (face) would give around 1111, which is one of the options, option G: 1111.97. But let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in (1.02)^30.

Alternatively, maybe I should use a more accurate value for (1.02)^30. Let me think again. I think (1.02)^30 is approximately 1.80611, so 1/1.80611 is about 0.5535.

So PV_coupons = 25 * [ (1 - 0.5535) / 0.02 ] = 25 * (0.4465 / 0.02) = 25 * 22.325 = 558.125.

PV_face = 1000 * 0.5535 = 553.50.

Adding them together: 558.125 + 553.50 = 1111.625. Hmm, which is close to option G: 1111.97. But perhaps my approximation of (1.02)^30 is a bit off.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact calculation for (1.02)^30. Let me see if I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the present value of an annuity and the face value.

Wait, another approach: the bond's value is the sum of all coupon payments discounted at the market rate and the face value at maturity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:

Bond Price = C * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ] + FV * (1 + r)^-n

Let me compute each part with more precision.

Compute (1 + r)^-n where r=0.02 and n=30.

I think the exact value of (1.02)^30 is approximately 1.80611. Let me check with a calculator. But since I don't have one, I'll proceed with this approximation.

So, 1/(1.02)^30 ≈ 1/1.80611 ≈ 0.5535.

Now, the coupon part:

PV_coupons = 25 * [1 - 0.5535] / 0.02 = 25 * (0.4465 / 0.02) = 25 * 22.325 = 558.125.

PV_face = 1000 * 0.5535 = 553.5.

Total Bond Price = 558.125 + 553.5 = 1111.625.

Looking at the options, option G is 1111.97, which is very close. So maybe my approximation of (1.02)^30 was a bit low. Let me check if (1.02)^30 is exactly 1.80611 or maybe a bit higher.

Wait, another way to compute (1.02)^30 more accurately. Let's compute it step by step:

Year 1: 1.02^1 = 1.02

Year 2: 1.02^2 = 1.0404

Year 3: 1.02^3 ≈ 1.061208

Year 4: 1.02^4 ≈ 1.082432

Year 5: 1.02^5 ≈ 1.10408

Year 6: 1.02^6 ≈ 1.12616

Year 7: 1.02^7 ≈ 1.148696

Year 8: 1.02^8 ≈ 1.171200

Year 9: 1.02^9 ≈ 1.194048

Year 10: 1.02^10 ≈ 1.218994

Now, to get to 30 years, I can compute (1.02)^10 ≈1.218994, so (1.02)^20 = (1.218994)^2 ≈ 1.218994 * 1.218994 ≈ 1.4844. Then (1.02)^30 = (1.4844) * (1.218994) ≈ 1.4844 * 1.218994 ≈ let's compute:

1.4844 * 1 = 1.4844

1.4844 * 0.2 = 0.29688

1.4844 * 0.018994 ≈ approximately 0.02834.

Adding up: 1.4844 + 0.29688 = 1.78128 + 0.02834 ≈ 1.80962.

So (1.02)^30 ≈ 1.80962, so (1.02)^-30 ≈ 1/1.80962 ≈ 0.5528.

So more accurately, 1/(1.02)^30 ≈0.5528.

Therefore, PV_coupons = 25 * [1 - 0.5528]/0.02 =25 * (0.4472/0.02) =25 *22.36=559.

Wait, 0.4472 divided by 0.02 is 22.36. So 25 *22.36=559.

PV_face=1000 *0.5528=552.8.

Total Bond Price=559 +552.8=1111.8.

Looking at the options, option G is 1111.97, which is very close. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but let me check the exact calculation using a financial calculator approach. Maybe I can use the formula for each part with more precision.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the present value of an annuity formula directly.

The present value of the coupons is 25 * [ (1 - (1.02)^-30 ) / 0.02 ]

We have (1.02)^-30 ≈0.5528, so 1 - 0.5528=0.4472.

0.4472 /0.02=22.36.

25 *22.36=559.

Then, the face value is 1000 *0.5528=552.8.

Total is 559 +552.8=1111.8, which is approximately 1111.80. The option G is 1111.97, which is very close. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but let me think again: another way to compute the present value. Maybe I made a mistake in the coupon frequency.

Wait, the bond pays $25 every six months, so each coupon is $25, and the market rate is 4% annually, so the semi-annual rate is 2%, correct.

Another way to compute the present value is using the formula for each coupon payment and sum them up, but that would be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity, which I think I did correctly.

Wait, let me verify with the formula again:

PV of coupons = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

=25 * [1 - (1.02)^-30 ] / 0.02

=25 * [1 - 0.5528 ] / 0.02

=25 * (0.4472 / 0.02 )

=25 *22.36=559.

PV of face value=1000/(1.02)^30=1000 *0.5528=552.8.

Total=559+552.8=1111.8.

So option G is 1111.97, which is very close. So I think that's the correct answer.
</think>

The bond is a 15-year, $1000 face value bond with semi-annual coupon payments of $25. The market interest rate is 4%, so the semi-annual rate is 2%. The bond's value is the present value of all coupon payments and the face value at maturity.

1. **Coupon Payments**:  
   The present value of the coupons is calculated using the present value of an annuity formula:  
   \[
   PV_{\text{coupons}} = 25 \times \frac{1 - (1.02)^{-30}}{0.02}
   \]  
   Approximating \((1.02)^{-30} \approx 0.5528\):  
   \[
   PV_{\text{coupons}} = 25 \times \frac{1 - 0.5528}{0.02} = 25 \times 22.36 = 559.00
   \]

2. **Face Value**:  
   The present value of the face value is:  
   \[
   PV_{\text{face}} = 1000 \times (1.02)^{-30} = 1000 \times 0.5528 = 552.80
   \]

3. **Total Bond Value**:  
   Adding the present values:  
   \[
   \text{Bond Price} = 559.00 + 552.80 = 1111.80
   \]  
   This is closest to option G: **1111.97**.
