Okay, so I need to figure out how much interest Mr. John Kirk has to pay on his $3,000 loan. The interest rate is 10 and a half percent, which is 10.5%, and the period is 180 days. Hmm, I remember that calculating interest can sometimes be a bit tricky depending on how the rate is applied over time.

First, I think I should recall the formula for simple interest. I believe it's I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate, and T is the time in years. But wait, the time here is given in days, so I need to convert 180 days into years. Since a year is 365 days, 180 days would be 180/365 of a year. Let me calculate that: 180 divided by 365. Let me see, 180 รท 365 is approximately 0.493 years. I can round it to about 0.493.

Now, the principal P is $3,000. The rate R is 10.5%, which is 0.105 in decimal form. So plugging these into the formula, I = 3000 * 0.105 * 0.493. Let me compute that step by step.

First, multiply 3000 by 0.105. 3000 * 0.105 is 315. Then, multiply that result by 0.493. So 315 * 0.493. Let me do the math: 315 * 0.493. Hmm, 315 times 0.4 is 126, 315 times 0.09 is 28.35, and 315 times 0.003 is 0.945. Adding those together: 126 + 28.35 is 154.35, plus 0.945 makes 155.295. So approximately $155.30.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one is I: $157.50. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the time is considered as 180/360 days, which is a common practice in finance for simplicity, treating a year as 360 days. Let me try that.

If T is 180/360 = 0.5 years. Then, I = 3000 * 0.105 * 0.5. Let's compute that: 3000 * 0.105 is 315, as before. Then 315 * 0.5 is 157.5. That gives exactly $157.50, which is option I.

So the correct answer should be I: $157.50.

The interest is calculated using the formula I = P * R * T. Converting 180 days to half a year (0.5 years) for simplicity, the calculation yields $157.50.

I: $157.50
