Question:

It's silly to pass laws against discrimination, since it is obvious that we can't live without it. We discriminate between pleasant and unpleasant tastes in selecting our food, between pleasant and unpleasant sounds in selecting our music, between harmonious and unharmonious colors in decorating our homes, between interesting and uninteresting people in choosing our friends, and so on. We can't live without discriminating.

Options:

A: Prejudicial Language
B: Equivocation
C: Inconsistency
D: Straw Man

Okay, so I've got this question about logical fallacies, and I need to figure out which one applies here. The statement is saying that it's silly to pass laws against discrimination because we can't live without it, using examples like choosing food, music, home decoration, and friends. Let me break this down.

First, the argument is that discrimination is natural and necessary in many areas of life, so laws against it are pointless. But wait, the examples given are about personal preferences, like tastes in food or music, which are subjective. On the other hand, the term "discrimination" in the context of laws usually refers to unfair treatment based on race, gender, etc., which is different from personal preferences.

So the person is using a broad term ("discrimination") and applying it in two different ways. In one sense, it's about making choices, and in another, it's about unfair practices. This seems like a type of equivocation, where the same word is used with different meanings. Equivocation is a logical fallacy where someone misuses a term by switching its meaning during an argument.

Looking at the options: A is Prejudicial Language, which is using language that shows bias, but I don't think that's the case here. B is Equivocation, which fits because they're using "discrimination" ambiguously. C is Inconsistency, which would be if the argument contradicted itself, but that's not the case. D is Straw Man, where someone misrepresents an opponent's argument, but the argument here isn't doing that.

So the correct answer should be B: Equivocation.

The argument uses the term "discrimination" in two different senses, creating a logical fallacy known as equivocation.

Answer: B
