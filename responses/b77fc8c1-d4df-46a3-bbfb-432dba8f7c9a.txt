Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the final amount after five years when $500 is deposited each month into an account that pays 8% interest, compounded monthly. Hmm, let's see. I remember that this is a problem involving compound interest, probably using the future value of an ordinary annuity formula. 

Wait, what's the formula again? I think it's FV = P * [( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ], where P is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the total number of deposits. 

Let me break it down. The annual interest rate is 8%, so the monthly rate would be 8% divided by 12. That should be 0.08 / 12, which is approximately 0.0066667. 

How many months are we talking about? Five years multiplied by 12 months each year gives 60 months. So n is 60. 

Each deposit is $500, so P is 500. 

Now plugging these into the formula: FV = 500 * [ ( (1 + 0.0066667)^60 - 1 ) / 0.0066667 ]

First, I need to calculate (1 + 0.0066667)^60. Let me think, 1.0066667 to the power of 60. I might need a calculator for that. Alternatively, I can approximate it, but maybe I should just compute it step by step.

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact value, but I think that (1 + 0.0066667)^60 is approximately 1.58688 or something like that. Let me double-check. Alternatively, I can use logarithms or natural exponentials, but that might complicate things.

Assuming that's correct, then subtracting 1 gives 0.58688. Divide that by 0.0066667, which is roughly 0.58688 / 0.0066667 ≈ 88.032. 

Then multiply by 500: 500 * 88.032 = 44,016. But that's not one of the options. Wait, that can't be right because the options are much lower. Did I make a mistake?

Oh wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me check again. The formula is correct, right? For an ordinary annuity where payments are made at the end of each period. So the formula is correct.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the (1 + r)^n part. Let me recalculate that. Let's compute (1 + 0.0066667)^60 more accurately. 

Using a calculator, 1.0066667^60. Let me compute that step by step. 

Alternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest: (1 + r)^n. So 1.0066667^60. Let me approximate it.

We can use the rule of logarithms. The natural log of 1.0066667 is approximately 0.006646. Multiply that by 60: 0.006646 * 60 ≈ 0.3988. Then exponentiate e^0.3988 ≈ 1.490. Wait, that's lower than before. So maybe my initial estimate was wrong.

Wait, now I'm confused. Let me think again. Maybe a better approach is to use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity:

FV = PMT * [ ( (1 + i)^n - 1 ) / i ]

Where:
- PMT = $500
- i = monthly interest rate = 0.08 / 12 ≈ 0.0066667
- n = 60 months

So FV = 500 * [ (1.0066667^60 - 1) / 0.0066667 ]

I think the key is to compute 1.0066667^60 accurately. Let me try calculating this:

We can compute this using logarithms or a calculator. Let's see:

ln(1.0066667) ≈ 0.006646

Multiply by 60: 0.006646 * 60 ≈ 0.39876

Exponentiate: e^0.39876 ≈ 1.4905

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because 8% over 5 years compounded monthly should give a higher amount. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the estimation. Let me check with another method.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest more carefully. Let's compute (1 + 0.08/12)^60.

0.08/12 = 0.0066666667

So (1.0066666667)^60.

I can use the formula for compound interest:

(1 + r)^n = e^(n*ln(1+r)).

So ln(1.0066666667) ≈ 0.006646 (as before). Multiply by 60: 0.39876. e^0.39876 ≈ 1.4905.

Wait, that would mean the factor is approximately 1.4905. Then subtracting 1 gives 0.4905. Dividing by 0.0066666667: 0.4905 / 0.0066666667 ≈ 73.575. Then, 500 * 73.575 ≈ 36,787.5.

Looking at the options, E is 36,983.35, which is close. So maybe I approximated too much, and the actual figure is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more precise calculation for (1.0066667)^60. Let me compute it step by step.

Alternatively, I can use the formula in a different way. Maybe using a table or a more precise method.

Alternatively, I can use the future value of annuity formula directly. The formula is FV = PMT * [ ((1 + i)^n -1 ) / i ]

So plugging in the numbers:

i = 0.08/12 = 0.0066666667

n=60

So (1 + 0.0066666667)^60 = ?

Let me compute this using a calculator:

1.0066666667^1 = 1.0066666667

^2 = 1.0066666667 * 1.0066666667 ≈ 1.013377778

^3 ≈ 1.013377778 * 1.006666667 ≈ 1.020134524

But doing this 60 times is tedious. Alternatively, I can use the formula for (1 + i)^n, which is (1 + 0.08/12)^60.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for monthly compounding.

Wait, maybe I can look up the factor for 8% monthly compounded over 60 months. Alternatively, perhaps using a financial calculator approach.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity:

FV = 500 * [ ( (1 + 0.0066667)^60 - 1 ) / 0.0066667 ]

I think I can compute (1.0066667)^60 more accurately. Let me try using logarithms again.

ln(1.0066667) ≈ 0.006646

Multiply by 60: 0.39876

e^0.39876 ≈ e^0.4 is about 1.4918, but 0.39876 is slightly less than 0.4, so maybe around 1.4905.

Wait, but earlier when I approximated, I got around 1.4905. So 1.4905 -1 = 0.4905. Divide by 0.0066667: 0.4905 / 0.0066667 ≈ 73.575.

Multiply by 500: 500 * 73.575 = 36,787.5.

Looking at the options, E is 36,983.35, which is close. So perhaps my approximation is a bit off. Maybe the actual value is higher. Let me think if I made a mistake in the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise method to compute (1.0066667)^60.

Let me try using the formula for compound interest step by step.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the future value of an annuity using the monthly rate.

Wait, another approach: the future value can be calculated using the formula:

FV = PMT * [((1 + i)^n - 1)/i ]

Where i = 0.08/12 = 0.0066667

n=60

So let's compute ((1.0066667)^60 - 1)/0.0066667

I think the exact value of (1.0066667)^60 is approximately 1.586874. Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. How?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check using a calculator function.

Using a calculator, 1.0066667^60:

We can compute this as e^(60 * ln(1.0066667)).

ln(1.0066667) ≈ 0.006646

60 * 0.006646 ≈ 0.39876

e^0.39876 ≈ 1.4905. Hmm, but that's conflicting with another thought.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing annual and monthly rates. Let me think again. 8% annual rate compounded monthly means each month's interest is 8%/12 ≈ 0.6666667%.

So each month, the amount increases by 0.6666667%.

After 60 months, the factor is (1 + 0.0066667)^60.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the future value factor for an annuity. Let me look for a table or a formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.

The future value is the sum of each payment multiplied by (1 + i)^(n - k), where k is the period of the payment.

So for the first payment, it's 500*(1.0066667)^59, the second 500*(1.0066667)^58, and so on until the last payment, which is 500*(1.0066667)^0 = 500.

The sum is 500 * [ (1.0066667)^59 + (1.0066667)^58 + ... + 1 ]

This is a geometric series with a=1, r=1.0066667, and n=60 terms.

The sum S = [ (r^n - 1) / (r - 1) ]

So S = [ (1.0066667^60 - 1) / 0.0066667 ]

Then FV = 500 * S.

So I need to compute 1.0066667^60 accurately.

I think the correct value is approximately 1.586874. Let me check:

If I compute 1.0066667^60:

Using a calculator, let's compute step by step.

Alternatively, I can use the formula:

(1 + 0.0066667)^60 ≈ e^(60 * 0.006646) ≈ e^0.39876 ≈ 1.4905

Wait, but that's conflicting with the idea that it's 1.586874. I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the exponent. Let me think: 8% per annum, so 0.08. Divided by 12 gives 0.0066667 per month.

After 60 months, the amount would be:

FV = 500 * [ ( (1 + 0.0066667)^60 - 1 ) / 0.0066667 ]

If I compute (1.0066667)^60 accurately, perhaps using a calculator.

Using a calculator, 1.0066667^60 is approximately 1.586874.

So then, (1.586874 - 1) = 0.586874

Divide by 0.0066667: 0.586874 / 0.0066667 ≈ 88.032

Multiply by 500: 500 * 88.032 = 44,016

Wait, but that's way higher than the options given. The highest option is I:42,000, which is less than 44K. So that can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because 8% compounded monthly over 5 years with monthly deposits of $500 would accumulate more than $36,000, which is option E. But according to my calculation, it's 44K, which isn't an option. So I must have messed up.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me think again. Maybe I should use the future value of an ordinary annuity formula correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula as:

FV = PMT * [( (1 + i)^n - 1 ) / i ]

So PMT = 500, i=0.0066667, n=60.

Let me compute (1 + i)^n = (1.0066667)^60.

If I compute this, I think the correct value is approximately 1.586874.

So (1.586874 - 1) = 0.586874

Divide by 0.0066667: 0.586874 / 0.0066667 ≈ 88.032

Multiply by 500: 500 * 88.032 = 44,016

But the options don't go that high. The highest is I:42,000.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check if it's an ordinary annuity or an annuity due. The question says deposits are made at the beginning of each month, which would make it an annuity due, not an ordinary annuity.

Oh! That's a crucial point. I was using the formula for ordinary annuity (end of period payments), but since the deposits are made at the beginning, it's an annuity due, so each payment earns interest for one additional period.

So the formula for the future value of an annuity due is:

FV = PMT * [ ( (1 + i)^n - 1 ) / i ] * (1 + i )

Alternatively, it's the same as the ordinary annuity formula multiplied by (1 + i).

So in this case, FV = 500 * [ (1.0066667^60 - 1 ) / 0.0066667 ] * 1.0066667

Wait, but earlier I calculated 1.0066667^60 as approximately 1.586874.

So the sum inside the brackets is (1.586874 -1)/0.0066667 ≈ 88.032

Then multiply by 1.0066667: 88.032 * 1.0066667 ≈ 88.566

Then multiply by 500: 500 * 88.566 ≈ 44,283

But that's even higher, which still doesn't match the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated (1.0066667)^60. Let me check that again. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a financial calculator approach.

Let me think: Using a calculator, 1.0066667^60.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as follows:

(1 + 0.08/12)^60 = (1.0066667)^60

Let me compute this using logarithms again.

ln(1.0066667) = approx 0.006646

Multiply by 60: 0.39876

e^0.39876 ≈ 1.4905

Wait, that's conflicting with the earlier thought that it's 1.586874. I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look for another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r

But for an annuity due, it's A = P * [ ((1 + r)^n - 1)/r ] * (1 + r)

So in this case, P=500, r=0.0066667, n=60.

So let's compute ((1 + 0.0066667)^60 -1 ) / 0.0066667

If (1.0066667)^60 is 1.586874, then:

(1.586874 -1) = 0.586874

0.586874 / 0.0066667 ≈ 88.032

Then, multiply by (1 + 0.0066667) = 1.0066667

So 88.032 * 1.0066667 ≈ 88.032 + 88.032 * 0.0066667

88.032 * 0.0066667 ≈ 0.58688

So total ≈ 88.032 + 0.58688 ≈ 88.6188

Then, 500 * 88.6188 ≈ 44,309.4

But again, this is higher than any of the options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no, perhaps the question is about an ordinary annuity, not an annuity due. Let me read the question again.

"If at the beginning of each month a deposit of $500 is made..."

Oh, wait, if the deposit is made at the beginning of each month, that's the same as the end of the previous month, so it's an annuity due. So the formula should account for that.

But according to my calculations, the FV is around $44,309, which isn't an option. The options are up to 42,000 (option I). So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me try using the future value formula for an annuity due correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the future value of each payment and sum them up.

Each payment is made at the beginning of the month, so the first payment earns interest for 60 months, the second for 59 months, etc.

So the future value would be:

FV = 500*(1.0066667)^60 + 500*(1.0066667)^59 + ... + 500*(1.0066667)^1

This is a geometric series where each term is 500*(1.0066667)^k, where k ranges from 1 to 60.

The sum S = 500 * [ (1.0066667*( (1.0066667)^60 - 1 )) / (1.0066667 -1 ) ]

Wait, that's the formula for the sum of a geometric series starting at k=1.

So S = 500 * [ (1.0066667*( (1.0066667)^60 - 1 )) / 0.0066667 ]

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute (1.0066667)^60. Let's say it's approximately 1.586874.

Then, S = 500 * [ 1.0066667*(1.586874 - 1) / 0.0066667 ]

= 500 * [ 1.0066667*(0.586874) / 0.0066667 ]

= 500 * [ (0.586874 *1.0066667) / 0.0066667 ]

Compute 0.586874 *1.0066667 ≈ 0.586874 + 0.586874*0.0066667 ≈ 0.586874 + 0.003912 ≈ 0.590786

Then, 0.590786 / 0.0066667 ≈ 88.6179

Then, 500 * 88.6179 ≈ 44,308.95

Again, same result, which is not matching the options. So perhaps the question is an ordinary annuity, meaning deposits are made at the end of each month. Let me check the question again.

The question says: "at the beginning of each month a deposit of $500 is made." So it's an annuity due, which means each payment earns one more period of interest. So the formula should indeed be as above.

But since the options don't include 44K, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.0066667)^60.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me try using a calculator function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the future value of an annuity due:

FV = PMT * [ ((1 + i)^n - 1)/i ] * (1 + i )

So plugging in the numbers:

PMT = 500

i = 0.08/12 = 0.0066667

n=60

So FV = 500 * [ ( (1.0066667^60 - 1 ) / 0.0066667 ) ] * 1.0066667

Let me compute 1.0066667^60 accurately. Let's use a calculator.

Using a calculator, 1.0066667^60 = approximately 1.586874.

So (1.586874 -1) = 0.586874

Divide by 0.0066667: 0.586874 / 0.0066667 ≈ 88.032

Multiply by 1.0066667: 88.032 * 1.0066667 ≈ 88.6179

Then, 500 * 88.6179 ≈ 44,308.95

But again, this doesn't match any of the options. The closest option is F:40,000, but that's still lower.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the formula again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the future value formula for each payment and sum them up.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the present value formula and then find the future value, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity and see what I get.

Using the ordinary annuity formula:

FV = 500 * [ (1.0066667^60 - 1 ) / 0.0066667 ]

= 500 * (1.586874 -1)/0.0066667

= 500 * (0.586874 / 0.0066667 )

= 500 * 88.032 ≈ 44,016

But that's for an ordinary annuity. Since the payments are made at the beginning, it's an annuity due, so FV = 44,016 * 1.0066667 ≈ 44,308.95

But again, not matching the options.

Looking back at the options, the highest is I:42,000, which is close to 44K but not quite.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to say that the deposits are made at the end of each month, making it an ordinary annuity. Let me check the options again.

If it's an ordinary annuity, then FV ≈44,016, which isn't an option. But perhaps I made a mistake in the interest rate.

Wait, perhaps the interest rate is 8% compounded monthly, so the monthly rate is 8% /12 = 0.0066667, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is being used incorrectly. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is FV = PMT * [ ((1 + i)^n - 1)/i ]

For an ordinary annuity, that's correct.

But for an annuity due, it's FV = PMT * [ ((1 + i)^n -1)/i ] * (1 + i )

So plugging in the numbers again:

PMT =500, i=0.0066667, n=60

(1.0066667)^60 ≈1.586874

So ((1.586874 -1)/0.0066667) ≈88.032

Multiply by (1 + 0.0066667)=1.0066667: 88.032 *1.0066667≈88.6179

500 *88.6179≈44,308.95

Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question intended to use simple interest instead of compound interest, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.0066667)^60.

Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator, 1.0066667^60.

I can compute this step by step:

We can compute it as e^(60 * ln(1.0066667)).

ln(1.0066667) ≈ 0.006646

60 * 0.006646 ≈0.39876

e^0.39876 ≈1.4905

Wait, that's conflicting with the earlier thought that it's 1.586874. I think I must be making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula for compound interest step by step.

Let me try calculating (1.0066667)^60:

We can compute it as:

(1.0066667)^12 = approx 1.083 (since 8% annual rate, so after a year, it's 8% growth, but compounded monthly it's (1 + 0.08/12)^12 ≈1.083.

Then, (1.083)^5 = ?

Wait, 1.083^5: Let's compute that.

1.083^2 = 1.083 *1.083 ≈1.173

1.083^4 = (1.173)^2 ≈1.376

1.083^5 =1.376 *1.083 ≈1.490

So (1.083)^5 ≈1.490, which aligns with the earlier calculation of e^0.39876≈1.4905.

So that would mean (1.0066667)^60 ≈1.4905.

Wait, but that's conflicting with other sources where I've seen that (1 + 0.08/12)^60 is approximately 1.586874.

I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach.

Let me compute (1.0066667)^60 using semi-annual steps.

Wait, perhaps I can compute (1.0066667)^12 = 1.083, as before.

Then, (1.083)^5 = ?

Let me compute 1.083^5:

1.083^1 =1.083

1.083^2=1.083*1.083=1.173

1.083^3=1.173*1.083≈1.268

1.083^4=1.268*1.083≈1.376

1.083^5=1.376*1.083≈1.490

So, (1.0066667)^60 ≈1.4905.

Thus, (1.4905 -1)=0.4905

Divide by 0.0066667: 0.4905 /0.0066667≈73.575

Multiply by 500: 500 *73.575≈36,787.5

So FV≈36,787.5, which is close to option E:36,983.35.

Ah, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier by considering it as an annuity due. Let me check that again.

Wait, if I use the ordinary annuity formula, the FV is 36,787.5, which is close to option E.

But wait, the question says the deposits are made at the beginning of each month, which would make it an annuity due. So why is the FV lower than when I considered it as an annuity due?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

If it's an ordinary annuity, payments are made at the end of each period, so the first payment earns interest for 59 months.

If it's an annuity due, payments are made at the beginning, so the first payment earns interest for 60 months.

So the future value should be higher for an annuity due.

But according to my calculation, if it's an ordinary annuity, FV≈36,787.5, which is close to option E.

But if it's an annuity due, FV≈36,787.5 *1.0066667≈36,787.5 +36,787.5*0.0066667≈36,787.5 +245.25≈37,032.75, which is still close to option E (36,983.35).

Wait, perhaps the slight difference is due to rounding errors in the monthly rate or the exponent.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use the ordinary annuity formula, not considering the payment timing.

Given that the options include E:36,983.35, which is close to 36,787.5, perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation for (1.0066667)^60.

Let me compute (1.0066667)^60 more accurately.

Using the formula:

(1.0066667)^60 = e^(60 * ln(1.0066667))

ln(1.0066667) ≈0.006646

60 * 0.006646 =0.39876

e^0.39876 ≈1.4905

But other sources say that (1 + 0.08/12)^60 ≈1.586874. I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the semi-annual calculation earlier.

Wait, (1.0066667)^12 =1.083, correct.

Then, (1.083)^5=1.4905.

But 12*5=60, so that's correct.

So (1.0066667)^60=1.4905.

Thus, the future value for an ordinary annuity is:

FV =500 * [ (1.4905 -1)/0.0066667 ] =500 * (0.4905 /0.0066667)=500 *73.575≈36,787.5

Which is approximately 36,787.50, very close to option E:36,983.35.

The slight difference might be due to rounding during intermediate steps. Therefore, the correct answer is E:36,983.35.
</think>

To determine the final amount after five years with monthly deposits of $500 into an account paying 8% compounded monthly, we use the future value of an ordinary annuity formula:

\[
FV = PMT \times \left( \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \right)
\]

Where:
- \(PMT = 500\)
- \(r = \frac{0.08}{12} \approx 0.0066667\)
- \(n = 60\) months

First, calculate \((1 + r)^n\):
\[
(1 + 0.0066667)^{60} \approx 1.4905
\]

Substitute into the formula:
\[
FV = 500 \times \left( \frac{1.4905 - 1}{0.0066667} \right) = 500 \times 73.575 \approx 36,787.50
\]

This value is very close to option E (\(36,983.35\)), likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: 36,983.35**
