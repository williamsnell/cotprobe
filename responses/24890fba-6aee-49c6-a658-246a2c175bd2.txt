Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this product liability question. Let me read it again. Bill bought a can of Sipep from Ajax Minimart. After drinking it, he found dead insects stuck on the inside bottom. Now, he's suing under strict product liability. The question is asking what Bill must prove, among the options given.

Hmm, product liability. I remember there are different types, like negligence, breach of warranty, and strict liability. Since this is strict liability, I think it's about defects. So, under strict liability, the plaintiff doesn't have to prove the defendant was negligent, just that the product was defective and caused harm.

Wait, the elements for strict product liability usually involve showing that the product was unreasonably dangerous due to a defect, and that the defect existed when the product left the defendant's control. Also, that the defect caused the injury.

Looking at the options, I need to pick what Bill must prove. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Ajax failed to warn. That's more about a failure to warn as a defect. But is that the only thing Bill needs to prove? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the only thing.

Option B: Ajax had prior notice. That might be relevant, but I think strict liability doesn't require the plaintiff to prove prior knowledge. It's more about the defect existing regardless of knowledge.

Option C: Ajax placed the insects. That sounds like a manufacturing defect, but does the plaintiff need to prove that the defendant did it specifically? I think strict liability doesn't require proving intent or specific action beyond the defect existing.

Option D: Insects caused harm. Well, Bill found insects, but did they cause him harm? The question says he noticed them after drinking, but maybe he's claiming they made him sick. But the question is about what he must prove in the action. I think he needs to show that the defect caused harm, but perhaps that's a given.

Option E: Ajax is a merchant. Well, that's probably true, but is that something he needs to prove? I don't think so. The fact that they're a merchant might be relevant to their duty, but the question is about what he must prove specifically.

Option F: Ajax knew or should have known. That sounds like negligence, because it's about knowledge. But in strict liability, you don't have to prove that the defendant knew; just that the product was defective when sold.

Option G: Can was sealed when purchased. That might show that the defect was present when the can was sealed, making it a manufacturing defect. So, if the can was sealed with insects inside, that could be a defect.

Option H: Consumed entire can. Not sure. Maybe relevant if he claims he ingested the insects, but I don't think that's a required element for strict liability.

Option I: Ajax had a duty to inspect. That's more about whether they took measures to prevent defects, but in strict liability, the duty is to provide a safe product, regardless of inspection procedures.

Option J: Ajax is the manufacturer. Wait, no, Ajax is a minimart, likely a retailer. If the product is defective, both manufacturers and retailers can be liable, but the question is about what Bill must prove. He might not need to prove who made it; the retailer can be liable if they sold a defective product.

Wait, the question is about what he must prove in a strict liability action. The key elements are: 1) the product was defective, 2) the defect existed when the product left the defendant's control, 3) the defect caused the injury, and 4) the product was intended for the market.

So, looking at the options, which of these relate to the defect existing when sold. Option G says the can was sealed when purchased. If the can was sealed, that implies that the defect (insects inside) was present when it left the manufacturer or distributor, and thus when Ajax sold it. So proving that the can was sealed when he bought it would show that the defect was there at the time of sale.

Alternatively, Option F says Ajax knew or should have known. But strict liability doesn't require knowledge; it's about whether the product was defective regardless of knowledge.

Option C is about Ajax placing the insects, but again, strict liability doesn't require proving that the defendant caused the defect, just that the product was defective when sold.

So, the correct answer is probably G: The Sipep can was sealed when Bill purchased it. Because that shows the defect was present at the time of sale, establishing that the product was defective when it left the defendant's hands.

In a strict product liability action, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the product was defective when it left the defendant's control. Among the options provided, the key element to prove is that the defect existed at the time of sale. Option G, which states that the can was sealed when Bill purchased it, is the correct choice because it establishes that the defect (dead insects) was present at the time of sale, satisfying the requirement for strict liability.

Answer: G
