Question:

What is the law of diminishing marginal utility?

Options:

A: This principle suggests that as more units of a good are consumed, the total utility decreases.
B: The law asserts that the marginal utility of a good increases at a decreasing rate as consumption increases.
C: The law suggests that utility does not change with consumption and remains static over time.
D: It states that each additional unit of consumption yields greater utility than the previous one, indefinitely.
E: It's a rule that says the first unit of a good or service consumed yields the least utility.
F: The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility refers to the fact that as successive units are consumed, the utility derived from each additional unit decreases beyond some point.
G: It indicates that the utility derived from each additional unit consumed remains constant no matter how many units are consumed.
H: It's the principle that states that as the quantity of a good decreases, the utility derived from each additional unit increases.
I: The law states that utility increases with each unit consumed.
J: The law claims that consumers derive equal utility from each additional unit consumed, regardless of the quantity already consumed.

Okay, so I need to figure out what the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility is. I remember hearing about it in my economics class, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through it step by step.

First, what's marginal utility? From what I recall, marginal utility refers to the additional satisfaction or benefit a consumer gets from consuming one more unit of a good or service. So, if I have a slice of pizza and I really love pizza, the first slice gives me a lot of happiness. But as I eat more slices, each additional slice gives me less extra happiness than the previous one. That's the idea, right?

The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, then, must be about this decreasing marginal utility as more units are consumed. So, it's not about the total utility decreasing, but rather about each additional unit giving less utility than the one before it. Let me check the options.

Option A says that as more units are consumed, total utility decreases. Wait, no, that's not right. Because even though each additional unit gives less utility, the total utility can still increase, just at a slower rate. So A might be incorrect.

Option B talks about marginal utility increasing at a decreasing rate. Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing. I think it's the opposite: marginal utility decreases as more units are consumed, not that it increases but at a decreasing rate. So B might not be correct.

Option C says utility doesn't change. No, that's not the case because the marginal utility does decrease, so C is wrong.

Option D states each additional unit gives greater utility indefinitely. That's the opposite of diminishing; that would be increasing marginal utility, so D is incorrect.

Option E claims the first unit yields the least utility. That doesn't make sense because usually, the first unit gives the most, and then it diminishes. So E is wrong.

Option F says as more units are consumed, the utility from each additional unit decreases beyond some point. That aligns with what I was thinking. So F seems correct.

Option G indicates utility remains constant. No, because marginal utility decreases, so G is incorrect.

Option H states that as quantity decreases, utility increases. That's not the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility; it's talking about the inverse scenario. So H is wrong.

Option I says utility increases with each unit. Again, that's the opposite of the law we're discussing. I is incorrect.

Option J claims each additional unit gives equal utility. That would be constant marginal utility, not diminishing. So J is wrong.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be F because it accurately describes the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility as the decrease in marginal utility with each additional unit consumed.

The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility describes how the additional satisfaction from consuming each extra unit of a good decreases as more units are consumed. This means that while total utility may increase, the rate at which it increases slows down, and each additional unit provides less utility than the previous one. 

Answer: F
