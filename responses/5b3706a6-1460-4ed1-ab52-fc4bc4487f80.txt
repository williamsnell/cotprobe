Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and trying to understand all the details.

The scenario is about a shopkeeper who owns a vacant lot in fee simple absolute. That means he has complete ownership. He conveyed this property using a general warranty deed in 1960. The deed says, "The grantor hereby conveys the vacant lot to my friend, but if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25." At the time, the sister was single. Later, she married and had two sons. One son died in an accident, and three years after that, she had a daughter. Now, there's a legal action to determine who owns the lot, with all minors represented. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I need to analyze the deed. The grantor (shopkeeper) conveyed the property to "my friend" but added a condition: if the property is ever used for church purposes, then it goes to the children of his sister who are 25. So, this looks like a conveyance with a condition subsequent or a fee simple determinable. Wait, but in property law, a conveyance like "to A, but if X happens, then to B" is usually a fee simple determinable because it's a limitation shifting the ownership upon a condition occurring. Alternatively, it could be a condition subsequent, but the phrasing here seems more like a limitation.

So, the friend gets the property initially. But if the property is used for church purposes, then ownership shifts to the sister's children who are 25. So, the friend has a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, or perhaps a determinable fee. Either way, the key is that the condition is the property being used for church purposes.

Now, the sister was single when the deed was made. She later married and had two sons. One son died, and three years after that, she had a daughter. So, the sister is now the mother of two sons (one deceased, one surviving) and a daughter. The daughter was born three years after the son's death.

The question is about ownership rights in an appropriate action, with all minors represented. So, we're looking at who has the right to the property now, considering the condition hasn't been triggered yet unless the property is used for church purposes.

I think the key here is whether the condition has been met. If the property is being used for church purposes, then the ownership shifts. But if not, the friend still owns it. The question doesn't specify that the property is being used for church purposes, so I assume it's not. So, the friend currently holds the property.

But wait, the deed includes a future interest for the sister's children. So, if the condition happens, the children would take. But since the condition hasn't happened, the friend holds the present interest. However, the question is about ownership rights in an appropriate action. Maybe the sister's children have some interest, but perhaps the friend is the current owner.

Wait, but the deed says "if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25." So, this is a contingent remainder. The friend has a fee simple subject to an executory interest, or perhaps a fee simple determinable with a shifting executory interest.

Alternatively, the friend's estate is a fee simple determinable, and the sister's children have an executory interest. So, the sister's children are the remaindermen, but their interest is contingent upon the property being used for church purposes.

But the sister's children are the ones who would take if the condition occurs. So, the friend holds the present possessory interest. But the sister's children have a vested remainder subject to divestment or a contingent remainder.

Wait, but in property law, when a grant is made "to A, but if X, then to B," that's a fee simple determinable with a shifting executory interest. So, A has a fee simple determinable, and B has an executory interest. The executory interest is vested in B but subject to open, meaning it's contingent on the condition happening.

In this case, the sister's children would take if the property is used for church purposes. So, the executory interest is in the sister's children. But the sister had two sons (one deceased, one alive), and a daughter. The daughter was born three years after the son's death. So, the sister's children are the two sons and the daughter.

But the question is about ownership rights now. The friend currently owns the property unless the condition is met. So, in an appropriate action, if the condition hasn't been met, the friend is the owner. But perhaps the question is about who has the right when the condition is met.

Wait, the question says "in an appropriate action to determine the ownership rights to the vacant lot with all minors represented." So, it's about who has the right now, considering the possibility of future interests.

Alternatively, maybe the condition has been met, and the ownership has shifted. But the question doesn't state that the property is being used for church purposes. So, I think the condition hasn't been met yet.

So, the friend is the current owner. But the sister's children have a future interest. So, if the condition occurs, they take. But in the absence of the condition, the friend owns it.

But the options are about who has the ownership rights now. So, the friend is the current owner, and the sister's children have a future interest. But the question is about ownership rights, which would include both present and future interests.

Wait, but ownership rights in the present sense would mean who owns it now. So, the friend owns it now. But the sister's children have a vested remainder subject to divestment or a contingent remainder.

Wait, but in the deed, the interest given to the sister's children is upon the condition happening. So, it's a contingent remainder. Therefore, the sister's children have a contingent remainder. So, their interest is not yet vested.

But the options are about who has ownership rights now. So, the friend is the owner, and the sister's children have a future interest but not current ownership.

But looking at the options:

Option E: the friend and any children of the sister reaching the age of 25.

Option J: the friend, the son, the daughter.

Option D: the friend, the deceased son, and the daughter.

Wait, but the sister's children are the two sons and the daughter. But the deceased son is dead, so can he have an interest? No, because he's deceased, so his interest would pass through inheritance, but in this case, the executory interest is in the sister's children as a class.

Wait, in property law, when you have a class gift, like "to my children," it creates a class that can include children born before the testator's death and those born afterward, as long as they are alive at the time of the event. But in this case, the executory interest is in the sister's children who reach 25. So, the class is the sister's children, and any child born to the sister after the conveyance would still be included in that class if they reach 25.

In this case, the sister had two sons (one deceased, one alive) and a daughter after the son's death. So, the daughter is part of the class. The deceased son is part of the class, but since he's deceased, his interest would pass to his heirs, but in the context of the executory interest, the class would include all living children at the time the condition occurs. However, since the condition hasn't occurred yet, the class is open.

So, the sister's children are the two sons and the daughter. But the deceased son is dead, so he can't own anything now. His interest, if any, would have passed, but in the context of the executory interest, it's the class that matters. So, when the condition occurs, the executory interest would go to the living children of the sister who are 25.

But the question is about current ownership. So, the friend owns the property now. The sister's children have a future interest, but they don't currently own the property. However, in some jurisdictions, future interests are considered ownership rights.

But looking at the options, option E says "the friend and any children of the sister reaching the age of 25." That suggests that the friend has the present interest, and the children have a future interest, but they are not current owners.

Option J says "the friend, the son, the daughter." But the son is deceased, so he can't own anything now. So, that might not be correct.

Option D says "the friend, the deceased son, and the daughter." Again, the son is deceased, so he can't have an ownership interest now.

Option C says "the friend only." That might be correct because the friend owns the property now, and the sister's children have a future interest but no present ownership.

Wait, but the question is about ownership rights, which could include both present and future interests. So, the friend has the present possessory interest, and the sister's children have a future interest. So, the correct answer would be that the friend is the current owner, and the sister's children have a vested remainder subject to divestment.

But looking at the options, option E says "the friend and any children of the sister reaching the age of 25." That seems to suggest that the friend has the present interest, and the children have a future interest. So, the ownership rights are in both.

Alternatively, the friend is the sole owner now, and the children have a future interest, but the question is about ownership rights, which might include both.

Wait, but in property law, when a deed creates a fee simple determinable with a shifting executory interest, the grantee (friend) holds the present possessory estate, and the remaindermen (sister's children) have an executory interest, which is a type of future interest.

So, the friend is the current owner, and the sister's children have a future interest. So, the ownership rights are in the friend, and the children have a future interest but not current ownership.

Looking at the options, option E says "the friend and any children of the sister reaching the age of 25." That seems to capture both the present and future interests. But the question is about ownership rights, which could encompass both.

But wait, the sister's children have a vested remainder subject to divestment. So, their interest is vested but subject to being divested if the condition occurs. So, they have a vested remainder, which is a present future interest.

So, in terms of ownership rights, the friend owns the present estate, and the children have a future interest. So, the correct answer would be that the friend owns the property now, and the sister's children have a future interest. Therefore, the ownership rights are in the friend and the children.

Looking at the options, option E says "the friend and any children of the sister reaching the age of 25." So, that seems correct.

Wait, but let's make sure. The sister had two sons and a daughter. The son is deceased, but the daughter is alive. So, the children are the two sons (one dead, one alive) and the daughter. But the daughter is a minor, so she's represented. The deceased son's interest would have passed through inheritance, but in the context of the executory interest, the class is the sister's children. So, the daughter is part of the class. The deceased son is part of the class as well, but since he's deceased, his interest would not be in the present ownership.

So, the friend is the current owner, and the sister's children (including the deceased son and the daughter) have a future interest. But since the son is deceased, his interest would have passed, but in the executory interest, it's the class that matters. So, when the condition is met, the property goes to the living children who are 25.

Therefore, the ownership rights are in the friend currently, and the sister's children have a future interest. So, the correct answer is E: the friend and any children of the sister reaching the age of 25.

The shopkeeper conveyed the property to the friend with a condition that if the property is used for church purposes, it will shift to the sister's children who reach 25. This creates a fee simple determinable in the friend and an executory interest in the sister's children. Since the condition has not been triggered, the friend owns the property now. The sister's children, including the deceased son and the daughter, have a future interest. The deceased son's interest would pass through inheritance, but in the executory interest context, the class remains open. Therefore, the ownership rights are in the friend and the sister's children who reach 25.
