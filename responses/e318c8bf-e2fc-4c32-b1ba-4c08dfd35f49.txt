Okay, so I've got this question about Velleman's views on euthanasia. I'm not super familiar with his arguments, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking what he thinks is the most significant way euthanasia might harm some patients.

First, I need to remember who Velleman is. I think he's a philosopher who has written about medical ethics, including euthanasia. From what I recall, he's concerned about the potential negative effects of legalizing euthanasia. One of his main arguments is about the impact on vulnerable patients.

The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Premature termination of life before exploring all treatment options. That makes sense because if euthanasia is an option, maybe some patients or doctors might consider it too quickly without trying all possible treatments. But I'm not sure if Velleman focuses on this as the most significant harm.

Option B: Burdening a patient with having to justify their continued existence. Hmm, this seems like it's about the psychological burden. If a patient has to constantly prove why they should live, that could be stressful. I think Velleman does talk about the pressure on patients to demonstrate their quality of life to others, which might lead them to feel they're a burden.

Option C: Eliminating the patient's capacity for self-determination. That sounds similar to B but more about the patient's autonomy. I'm not sure if that's what Velleman emphasizes. He might argue that the process could interfere with their ability to make their own decisions, but I'm not certain.

Option D: Tempting a patient to undergo a painful procedure. That doesn't seem right. Euthanasia is about ending life, not necessarily about medical procedures. I don't think this is the main point Velleman is making.

Option E: Eliminating opportunities for self-determination. Again, similar to C, but perhaps more about the opportunities rather than the capacity. I'm not sure if this is the focus.

Option F: Psychological distress to loved ones. That's a valid concern, but I think it's more about the family's feelings rather than the patient's direct harm. Velleman might focus more on the patient's experience.

Option G: Unnecessary physical pain. Euthanasia is often about ending suffering, so this seems contradictory. I don't think Velleman's main point is about causing more pain.

Option H: Undermining trust in medical professionals. If doctors are offering euthanasia, maybe patients would lose trust, but I'm not sure if that's the primary harm Velleman identifies.

Option I: Reducing recovery chances. Similar to A, but again, I'm not sure if that's his main concern.

Option J: Societal pressure to opt for euthanasia. This could happen, but I think Velleman's focus is more on the individual patient's experience rather than societal pressure.

Putting it together, I think Velleman's main concern is about the psychological burden on patients. He argues that if euthanasia is an option, patients might feel pressured to end their lives if they can't show they have a good quality of life. This would be option B. Alternatively, maybe it's about self-determination, but I think B is more about the burden of justification.

Wait, but in some of his writings, he talks about the "tyranny of the positive attitude," where patients are expected to have a positive outlook to be considered worthy of life. So, the burden of justifying their existence is a significant point. So I think the answer is B.

The correct answer is **B**: by burdening a patient with having to justify his or her continued existence.

Velleman argues that euthanasia can harm patients by placing a heavy psychological burden on them, as they may feel the need to continually justify their right to life, particularly if societal or medical pressures emphasize a positive quality of life as a criterion for it. This burden can lead patients to question their worth and may even result in them feeling pressured to end their lives if they cannot meet these expectations. 

**Answer: B**
