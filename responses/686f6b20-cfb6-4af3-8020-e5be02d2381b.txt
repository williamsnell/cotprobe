Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about supply-side economics, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about supply-side economics. I remember that it's an economic theory that suggests that lower taxes and reduced regulation can increase economic growth by encouraging businesses to produce more. The idea is that if you give businesses and individuals more incentive to invest, produce, and work, the overall economy will grow, and this will lead to higher tax revenues even though the rates are lower.

The question is asking which of the options is most likely preferred by supply-side economists. The options are A through J. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Lower taxes on household income. That makes sense because supply-siders believe in reducing taxes to increase disposable income, which can lead to more saving and investing. This would directly align with their theory.

Option B: A tax credit on capital investment. Tax credits are incentives to encourage certain behaviors. Capital investment tax credits would reduce the cost of investing in capital goods, which should increase business investment. That also seems like something supply-siders would support.

Option C: Increased government spending. Wait, supply-side focuses more on the supply side of the economy, not the demand side. Increased spending is more of a Keynesian approach, which is about boosting demand. So I don't think supply-siders would prefer this.

Option D: Higher tariffs on imported goods. Higher tariffs are protectionist measures. I'm not sure if that's directly related to supply-side policies. Maybe it's more about trade policy, but I don't think it's the primary focus of supply-side economics.

Option E: A tax on wealth. That's more of a progressive tax approach, which might be the opposite of what supply-siders want. They prefer lower taxes across the board, not targeting specific groups or wealth.

Option F: Government regulation of industry. Supply-siders generally oppose excessive regulation because it can stifle business activity and innovation. So this would be against their preferences.

Option G: Increased minimum wage. This is a demand-side policy aimed at boosting workers' incomes, which can increase consumer spending. Not something supply-siders would prioritize.

Option H: Higher corporate tax rates. This is the opposite of what supply-siders want. They would prefer lower corporate taxes to encourage business investment and production.

Option I: Reduction in defense spending. This seems more like a fiscal policy decision, not directly tied to supply-side principles. It might be about budget allocation but not the main focus.

Option J: Increased social welfare programs. Again, this is more about demand-side economics, as it increases spending on social services, which boosts demand. Supply-siders are more concerned with reducing taxes and regulation.

So, looking back, the key points are lower taxes and reduced regulation. Option A is about lower taxes on household income, which directly fits. Option B is a tax credit, which is also a tax incentive but more specific to capital investment. I think both A and B are good, but which one is more preferred?

Supply-side economists might prioritize tax cuts that broadly reduce the burden on households and businesses, which would include both A and B. However, the question asks for the most likely preferred choice. Lowering taxes on household income (A) is a more general tax cut, whereas a tax credit on capital investment (B) is a specific incentive. I think both are correct, but maybe A is more fundamental because it's about overall tax reduction, which is a core supply-side principle.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes supply-siders also focus on incentives for investment, so B might be equally important. But in the context of the options given, both A and B are plausible. However, the question is asking for the one most likely preferred, so perhaps the more direct answer is A because it's a general tax cut, which is a hallmark of supply-side policies. Alternatively, I've read that tax incentives for investment (like tax credits) are also a key part of supply-side approaches, especially for encouraging businesses to invest more.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me think again. The main idea is that supply-siders believe that lowering taxes, especially on businesses and savings, will lead to more production and economic growth. So both lower taxes on income (A) and tax credits for capital investment (B) fit this. But if I have to choose the most likely, perhaps A is more directly aligned because it's about reducing the tax burden on households, which increases their disposable income and thus their ability to save and invest.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that capital investment is a key driver of economic growth, so a tax credit (B) would be more preferred because it directly targets investment. I'm a bit stuck here. But I think the most fundamental supply-side policy is lower taxes on income, so I'll go with A.

The correct answer is **A: lower taxes on household income**. Supply-side economists prioritize reducing taxes to increase disposable income, encouraging saving and investment, which aligns with their belief in boosting economic growth through lower tax burdens.
