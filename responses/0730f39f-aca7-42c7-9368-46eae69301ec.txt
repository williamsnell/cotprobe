Okay, so I have this differential equation to solve: y' equals (t squared plus 3y squared) divided by 2ty. The initial condition is y(1) equals 1, and I need to find y(2). The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the equation y' = (t² + 3y²)/(2ty). That looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it or recognize the type of equation it is. Let me rewrite it to see if it fits a standard form.

So, y' = (t² + 3y²)/(2ty). Let me separate the terms in the numerator: (t²)/(2ty) + (3y²)/(2ty). Simplifying each term, that becomes (t)/(2y) + (3y)/(2t). So, y' = (t)/(2y) + (3y)/(2t).

Wait, that simplifies to y' = (t)/(2y) + (3y)/(2t). Hmm, maybe I can factor out 1/(2t y) or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this is a homogeneous equation. Let me check. A differential equation is homogeneous if it can be written as y' = f(y/t). Let's see.

Let me try substituting v = y/t. Then y = v t, so dy/dt = v + t dv/dt. Let's plug that into the equation. So, dy/dt = (t² + 3y²)/(2ty).

Substituting y = v t, the RHS becomes (t² + 3(v t)^2)/(2t (v t)) = (t² + 3v² t²)/(2 t² v) = (1 + 3v²)/(2v). So, dy/dt = (1 + 3v²)/(2v).

But dy/dt is also v + t dv/dt. So, setting them equal: v + t dv/dt = (1 + 3v²)/(2v).

Let me rearrange this equation. Subtract v from both sides: t dv/dt = (1 + 3v²)/(2v) - v. Let me compute the right side: (1 + 3v²)/(2v) - v = [1 + 3v² - 2v²]/(2v) = [1 + v²]/(2v).

So now, t dv/dt = (1 + v²)/(2v). This looks like a separable equation. Let me write it as:

dv/dt * t = (1 + v²)/(2v)

Which can be rewritten as:

(2v)/(1 + v²) dv = dt/t

Yes, now I can integrate both sides. So, integrating the left side with respect to v and the right side with respect to t.

The integral of (2v)/(1 + v²) dv. Let me make a substitution: let u = 1 + v², then du = 2v dv. So, the integral becomes ∫ du/u = ln|u| + C = ln(1 + v²) + C.

The integral of dt/t is ln|t| + C. So putting it together:

ln(1 + v²) = ln t + C

Exponentiating both sides to eliminate the logarithms:

1 + v² = C t

Where C is e^C, just another constant. Now, substituting back v = y/t:

1 + (y/t)² = C t

Multiply both sides by t² to eliminate denominators:

t² + y² = C t³

So, the equation becomes y² = C t³ - t².

Now, apply the initial condition y(1) = 1. So, when t=1, y=1. Plug that in:

1² = C (1)^3 - (1)^2 => 1 = C - 1 => C = 2.

So, the solution is y² = 2t³ - t². Therefore, y = sqrt(2t³ - t²).

Now, we need to find y(2). So plug t=2 into the equation:

y² = 2*(2)^3 - (2)^2 = 2*8 -4 = 16 -4 =12. So y = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3) ≈ 3.464.

Wait, that's one of the options. Looking back, option J is 3.464. So the answer should be J.

The differential equation is solved using substitution, leading to the solution y² = 2t³ - t². Applying the initial condition y(1) = 1 determines the constant C = 2. Evaluating y at t=2 gives y(2) ≈ 3.464, which corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
