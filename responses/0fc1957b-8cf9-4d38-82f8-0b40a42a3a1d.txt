Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the arc length of the curve y = (1/4)x^4 from x=1 to x=2 using the Trapezoidal Rule with n=5. Hmm, I remember that the formula for arc length involves an integral, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think.

First, the general formula for the arc length of a function y = f(x) from a to b is the integral from a to b of sqrt(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx. Right, so I need to compute that integral, but since it's a bit complicated, I'll use the Trapezoidal Rule to approximate it.

Wait, what's the derivative of y here? y = (1/4)x^4, so dy/dx is (1/4)*4x^3, which simplifies to x^3. So, (f'(x))^2 is (x^3)^2 = x^6. Therefore, the integrand becomes sqrt(1 + x^6). So the integral we're looking at is from x=1 to x=2 of sqrt(1 + x^6) dx.

Now, the Trapezoidal Rule T_n approximates the integral by dividing the interval [a, b] into n subintervals, each of width h = (b - a)/n. Here, a=1, b=2, and n=5, so h = (2-1)/5 = 0.2. That means each step is 0.2 units wide.

The Trapezoidal Rule formula is: T_n = h/2 [f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + ... + 2f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n)]. So, I'll need to compute this sum.

Let me list the x values first. Starting from 1, with h=0.2, the points are:
x0 = 1
x1 = 1.2
x2 = 1.4
x3 = 1.6
x4 = 1.8
x5 = 2.0

Now, I need to compute f(x) at each of these points, where f(x) = sqrt(1 + x^6).

Let me compute each f(x_i):

f(x0) = sqrt(1 + 1^6) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142

f(x1) = sqrt(1 + (1.2)^6). Let's calculate (1.2)^6. 1.2^2=1.44, 1.2^3=1.728, 1.2^4=2.0736, 1.2^5=2.48832, 1.2^6=2.985984. So f(x1)=sqrt(1 + 2.985984)=sqrt(3.985984)≈1.9965

f(x2)=sqrt(1 + (1.4)^6). Let's compute 1.4^6. 1.4^2=1.96, 1.4^3=2.744, 1.4^4=3.8416, 1.4^5=5.37824, 1.4^6=7.529536. So f(x2)=sqrt(1+7.529536)=sqrt(8.529536)≈2.921.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should compute each step more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute each f(x_i) step by step:

x0=1: f= sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2)=1.41421356.

x1=1.2: 1.2^6. Let's compute 1.2^2=1.44, 1.2^4=(1.44)^2=2.0736, 1.2^6= (1.44)*(2.0736)= 2.985984. So f(x1)=sqrt(1 +2.985984)=sqrt(3.985984). Let me compute that: sqrt(3.985984) ≈1.99649034.

x2=1.4: 1.4^2=1.96, 1.4^3=2.744, 1.4^4=3.8416, 1.4^5=5.37824, 1.4^6=7.529536. So f(x2)=sqrt(1+7.529536)=sqrt(8.529536). Let me compute that: sqrt(8.529536) ≈2.921 (exact value? Let me compute 2.921^2: 2.921*2.921=8.529 (since 2.9^2=8.41, 2.92^2=8.5264, 2.921^2≈8.529). So f(x2)=2.921.

x3=1.6: Let's compute 1.6^6. 1.6^2=2.56, 1.6^3=4.096, 1.6^4=6.5536, 1.6^5=10.48576, 1.6^6=16.777056. So f(x3)=sqrt(1+16.777056)=sqrt(17.777056). Let's compute that: sqrt(17.777056). I know that 4.2^2=17.64 and 4.21^2=17.7241, 4.22^2=17.8084. So 17.777 is between 4.21 and 4.22. Let me compute 4.215^2: 4.215*4.215= (4 + 0.215)^2=16 + 2*4*0.215 + 0.215^2=16 + 1.72 + 0.046225=17.766225. Hmm, close to 17.777. So maybe about 4.216.

Wait, 4.216^2= (4.215 + 0.001)^2=4.215^2 + 2*4.215*0.001 + 0.001^2=17.766225 + 0.00843 + 0.000001≈17.774656. Still a bit less than 17.777056. Next, 4.217^2=4.216^2 + 2*4.216*0.001 + 0.001^2≈17.774656 + 0.008432 + 0.000001≈17.783089. So 4.217^2≈17.783089, which is a bit higher than 17.777056. So the square root is approximately 4.2165. Let's take f(x3)=4.2165.

x4=1.8: Let's compute 1.8^6. 1.8^2=3.24, 1.8^3=5.832, 1.8^4=10.4976, 1.8^5=18.89568, 1.8^6=34.012224. So f(x4)=sqrt(1 +34.012224)=sqrt(35.012224). Let's compute that: sqrt(35.012224). Since 5.916^2=35. So let me compute 5.916^2: 5*5=25, 5*0.916=4.58, 0.916^2≈0.839. Wait, no, better to compute 5.916*5.916.

Alternatively, 5.9^2=34.81, 5.91^2=34.9281, 5.916^2= (5.91 + 0.006)^2=5.91^2 + 2*5.91*0.006 + 0.006^2=34.9281 + 0.07092 + 0.000036=34.999056. Oh, so 5.916^2≈34.999056, which is very close to 35.012224. So f(x4)=sqrt(35.012224)= approximately 5.916 + a bit. Let's see, the difference is 35.012224 -34.999056=0.013168. So using linear approximation, the derivative of sqrt(x) at x=35 is 1/(2*sqrt(35))≈1/(2*5.916)=approx 0.0845.

So, delta x=0.013168, so delta y≈0.013168*0.0845≈0.001115. So f(x4)=5.916 + 0.001115≈5.917115. Let's take f(x4)=5.9171.

x5=2.0: f(x5)=sqrt(1 +2^6)=sqrt(1 +64)=sqrt(65)=approx 8.0622577.

Wait, let me summarize all the f(x_i):

x0=1: f=1.41421356
x1=1.2: f≈1.99649034
x2=1.4: f≈2.921
x3=1.6: f≈4.2165
x4=1.8: f≈5.9171
x5=2.0: f≈8.0622577

Now, applying the Trapezoidal Rule:

T5 = h/2 [f(x0) + 2(f(x1) + f(x2) + f(x3) + f(x4)) + f(x5)]

h=0.2, so h/2=0.1.

So let's compute the sum inside:

f(x0) + 2*(f(x1)+f(x2)+f(x3)+f(x4)) + f(x5)

= 1.41421356 + 2*(1.99649034 + 2.921 + 4.2165 +5.9171) +8.0622577

Let me compute the sum inside the 2*:

1.99649034 +2.921 = 4.91749034

4.91749034 +4.2165 =9.13399034

9.13399034 +5.9171=15.05109034

Now multiply by 2: 2*15.05109034=30.10218068

Add f(x0) and f(x5):

30.10218068 +1.41421356=31.51639424

31.51639424 +8.0622577≈39.57865194

Now, multiply by h/2=0.1:

0.1 *39.57865194≈3.957865194.

Hmm, looking at the options, option H is 3.958, which is very close to this value. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in adding or computing the squares.

Wait, let me recheck the f(x3) and f(x4) computations because those are the more complex parts.

For x3=1.6, 1.6^6: 1.6^2=2.56, ^3=4.096, ^4=6.5536, ^5=10.48576, ^6=16.777056. So sqrt(1 +16.777056)=sqrt(17.777056). My earlier approximation was 4.2165. Let me compute 4.2165^2: 4.2165 *4.2165.

Let me compute 4.2 *4.2=17.64. 0.0165 *4.2=0.0693, and same for the other term. Alternatively, use (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.

So, 4.2165^2 = (4.2 +0.0165)^2 = 4.2^2 + 2*4.2*0.0165 +0.0165^2= 17.64 + 0.1386 + 0.00027225=17.64+0.1386=17.7786 +0.00027225≈17.77887225. But the actual value was 17.777056, so 4.2165^2 is 17.77887225, which is a bit higher than 17.777056. So the square root should be slightly less than 4.2165. Let's see, 4.216^2: 4.216^2= (4.216)^2. Let me compute 4.216 *4.216.

Compute 4*4=16, 4*0.216=0.864, 0.216*4=0.864, 0.216*0.216=0.046656.

But wait, that's not the right way. Let me compute it step by step:

4.216 *4.216:

Break it down as (4 + 0.216)^2 = 16 + 2*4*0.216 + 0.216^2 =16 + 1.728 + 0.046656=17.774656.

Wait, that's lower than 17.777056. So 4.216^2=17.774656, and 4.2165^2≈17.778872. So the sqrt(17.777056) is between 4.216 and 4.2165.

Compute 4.216 + d, where (4.216 +d)^2=17.777056.

We have 4.216^2=17.774656. The difference is 17.777056 -17.774656=0.0024.

So, 2*4.216*d + d^2 =0.0024. Since d is small, d^2 is negligible. So 2*4.216*d≈0.0024 → d≈0.0024/(2*4.216)=0.0024/8.432≈0.000284. So sqrt≈4.216 +0.000284≈4.216284.

So f(x3)= approximately 4.216284. Let's use this value.

Similarly, for x4=1.8, 1.8^6=34.012224. So f(x4)=sqrt(35.012224). Let me compute sqrt(35.012224).

I know that 5.916^2=34.999056 as computed earlier. The difference is 35.012224 -34.999056=0.013168. So, using linear approximation again, the derivative of sqrt(x) is (1/(2*sqrt(x))) at x=35, which is 1/(2*5.916)=approx 0.0845.

So delta y≈0.013168 *0.0845≈0.001115. So sqrt(35.012224)=5.916 +0.001115≈5.917115. So f(x4)=5.917115.

Let me recompute the sum with these more accurate values.

f(x0)=1.41421356

f(x1)=1.99649034

f(x2)=2.921

f(x3)=4.216284

f(x4)=5.917115

f(x5)=8.0622577

Now, the sum for Trapezoidal:

= f(x0) + 2*(f(x1)+f(x2)+f(x3)+f(x4)) + f(x5)

Compute the sum inside the 2*:

f(x1) + f(x2) + f(x3) + f(x4) = 1.99649034 +2.921 +4.216284 +5.917115.

Let me add step by step:

1.99649034 +2.921 =4.91749034

4.91749034 +4.216284=9.13377434

9.13377434 +5.917115=15.05088934

Multiply by 2: 2*15.05088934=30.10177868

Now add f(x0) and f(x5):

30.10177868 +1.41421356=31.51599224

31.51599224 +8.0622577=39.57825

Multiply by h/2=0.1: 0.1 *39.57825=3.957825.

So approximately 3.9578, which rounds to 3.958. Therefore, the answer is H:3.958.

To find the arc length of \( y = \frac{1}{4}x^4 \) over the interval \([1, 2]\) using the Trapezoidal Rule \( T_5 \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Arc Length Formula**: The arc length \( L \) of \( y = f(x) \) from \( x = a \) to \( x = b \) is given by:
   \[
   L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1 + \left( f'(x) \right)^2} \, dx
   \]
   For \( f(x) = \frac{1}{4}x^4 \), the derivative is \( f'(x) = x^3 \), so the integrand becomes:
   \[
   \sqrt{1 + x^6}
   \]

2. **Trapezoidal Rule Setup**: Divide the interval \([1, 2]\) into \( n = 5 \) subintervals, each of width \( h = \frac{2-1}{5} = 0.2 \). The Trapezoidal Rule formula is:
   \[
   T_5 = \frac{h}{2} \left[ f(x_0) + 2\sum_{i=1}^{4} f(x_i) + f(x_5) \right]
   \]
   where \( x_i = 1 + i \cdot 0.2 \) for \( i = 0, 1, \ldots, 5 \).

3. **Compute Function Values**:
   - \( x_0 = 1 \): \( f(x_0) = \sqrt{1 + 1^6} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142 \)
   - \( x_1 = 1.2 \): \( f(x_1) = \sqrt{1 + (1.2)^6} \approx 1.9965 \)
   - \( x_2 = 1.4 \): \( f(x_2) = \sqrt{1 + (1.4)^6} \approx 2.921 \)
   - \( x_3 = 1.6 \): \( f(x_3) = \sqrt{1 + (1.6)^6} \approx 4.2163 \)
   - \( x_4 = 1.8 \): \( f(x_4) = \sqrt{1 + (1.8)^6} \approx 5.9171 \)
   - \( x_5 = 2.0 \): \( f(x_5) = \sqrt{1 + 2^6} = \sqrt{65} \approx 8.0623 \)

4. **Apply Trapezoidal Rule**:
   \[
   T_5 = \frac{0.2}{2} \left[ 1.4142 + 2(1.9965 + 2.921 + 4.2163 + 5.9171) + 8.0623 \right]
   \]
   Compute the sum inside:
   \[
   1.4142 + 2(15.0509) + 8.0623 = 1.4142 + 30.1018 + 8.0623 = 39.5783
   \]
   Multiply by \( \frac{0.2}{2} = 0.1 \):
   \[
   T_5 = 0.1 \times 39.5783 \approx 3.9578
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: The approximate arc length is \( 3.958 \), which corresponds to option **H**.

Answer: H
