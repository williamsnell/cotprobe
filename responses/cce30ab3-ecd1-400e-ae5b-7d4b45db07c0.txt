Okay, so I have this question about the nonprofit sector and how many practitioners conduct audience research. The options are A through I, with various percentages. I'm not exactly sure, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I know that audience research is important for nonprofits because they need to understand their supporters and the people they serve to create effective programs and fundraising strategies. But how often do they actually do it?

I remember reading some articles that suggested that while many nonprofits recognize the importance of research, not all of them have the resources to conduct it regularly. Nonprofits often have limited budgets compared to for-profit companies, so maybe they don't invest as much in research.

On the other hand, larger nonprofits might have more resources and could be doing more research. But the question is about the proportion overall, not just large ones. So if a lot of smaller nonprofits can't afford it, the overall percentage might be lower.

Looking at the options, A is one-half, which is 50%. B is less than 10%, which seems low. C is nearly all, which I don't think is right because I don't recall hearing that most nonprofits are doing regular research. D is more than 80%, E is about 90%, which are both high. F is three quarters, G is one-quarter, H is one third, I is two thirds.

I think it's somewhere between one-third to half. Maybe around one-third? Or perhaps more. But I'm not sure. Wait, I think I've heard that about a third of nonprofits do some level of audience research, but maybe that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe it's more than that. If I consider that many nonprofits at least do some basic research, like surveys or focus groups, maybe it's higher. Perhaps two-thirds? Or even a half.

Wait, another angle: in the for-profit sector, it's much higher, but nonprofits might have less capacity. So maybe around one-third or one-quarter conduct regular audience research. So looking at the options, H is one third, G is one-quarter.

I'm leaning towards one-quarter because I think many smaller nonprofits might not have the resources. So the answer might be G: One-quarter.

The question asks about the proportion of nonprofit sector practitioners who conduct audience research. Considering the challenges nonprofits face, such as limited resources, it's likely that not all engage in regular research. While some may do basic research, the proportion is probably lower. Based on the options, one-quarter seems plausible as many smaller nonprofits might lack the capacity for extensive research.
