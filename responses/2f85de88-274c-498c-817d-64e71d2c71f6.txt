Question:

 Which of the following is one of de Marneffe's responses to the objection that drug prohibition would be paternalistic?

Options:

A: Paternalism is always justified when the paternalistic practices truly are in the best interest of those affected.
B: Drug prohibition would be paternalistic, but its consequences would be good enough to outweigh considerations about paternalism.
C: Paternalism is a positive trait when it helps guide individuals away from harmful behaviors like drug use.
D: Drug prohibition would be a form of societal control, not paternalism.
E: Drug prohibition would be targeted to adults, and one can only be paternalistic toward children.
F: Drug prohibition would be paternalistic, but it is a necessary evil to maintain order and protect public health.
G: The concept of paternalism doesn't apply to the issue of drug prohibition.
H: Drug prohibition is not paternalistic as it does not impose a 'parent-like' authority over individuals.
I: Drug prohibition would not be paternalistic because it would protect society from the harmful effects of drugs.
J: Drug prohibition would be done for the benefit of others, not the benefit of those who wish to produce/sell drugs, so it is not paternalistic in an objectionable sense.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of the options A through J is de Marneffe's response to the objection that drug prohibition is paternalistic. I'm not super familiar with de Marneffe's arguments, but I can try to work through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what the objection is saying. The objection is that drug prohibition is paternalistic. Paternalism usually refers to actions that restrict people's freedom for their own good, like when a government imposes rules it thinks are in people's best interests. So, someone opposing drug prohibition might argue that by prohibiting drugs, the government is acting paternalistically, limiting people's choices to use drugs even if those individuals might choose otherwise.

De Marneffe is likely responding to this objection by either justifying paternalism in this context or arguing why drug prohibition isn't paternalistic. I need to look at each option to see which one aligns with a possible response.

Let me go through each option:

A: "Paternalism is always justified when the paternalistic practices truly are in the best interest of those affected." This suggests that if the outcome is good, paternalism is okay. So de Marneffe might accept some paternalism if it's for the right reasons. But is this his response specifically about drug prohibition?

B: "Drug prohibition would be paternalistic, but its consequences would be good enough to outweigh considerations about paternalism." Here, the argument is that even though it's paternalistic, the benefits are so great that it's justified. This seems plausible as a response, balancing the paternalism against the positive outcomes.

C: "Paternalism is a positive trait when it helps guide individuals away from harmful behaviors like drug use." This argues that paternalism is good in this specific case because it stops people from using drugs, which are harmful. So de Marneffe might be saying that paternalism here is a positive thing.

D: "Drug prohibition would be a form of societal control, not paternalism." This is saying that prohibition isn't paternalistic because it's more about control. But I'm not sure if that's de Marneffe's take.

E: "Drug prohibition would be targeted to adults, and one can only be paternalistic toward children." This seems off because drug prohibition doesn't target only children, it's for everyone. So I don't think this is the right answer.

F: "Drug prohibition would be paternalistic, but it is a necessary evil to maintain order and protect public health." This suggests that while it's paternalistic, the necessity for order and public health makes it acceptable. It's a bit negative but could be a possible response.

G: "The concept of paternalism doesn't apply to the issue of drug prohibition." This would mean that the objection is invalid because drug prohibition isn't paternalistic. I'm not sure if de Marneffe would take this stance.

H: "Drug prohibition is not paternalistic as it does not impose a 'parent-like' authority over individuals." This argues that paternalism requires a parent-like role, which drug laws don't impose. So, maybe de Marneffe is saying it's not paternalistic because it's not acting like a parent.

I: "Drug prohibition would not be paternalistic because it would protect society from the harmful effects of drugs." This is similar to option C but focuses on protecting society rather than individuals. So de Marneffe might argue that it's not paternalistic because it's about societal protection, not individual good.

J: "Drug prohibition would be done for the benefit of others, not the benefit of those who wish to produce/sell drugs, so it is not paternalistic in an objectionable sense." This suggests that since the benefit is to others (society) rather than the individuals, it's not paternalistic. That's an interesting point because paternalism usually involves acting for the individual's own good, not for others' sake.

Now, I need to think about which of these aligns with de Marneffe's likely response. I recall that some philosophers argue that paternalism can be acceptable if it's for significant benefits. For example, Michael Sandel has discussed this, but I'm not sure about de Marneffe. Alternatively, others might argue that societal protection is a different issue, not paternalism.

Looking at the options, option B says that the consequences are good enough to outweigh the paternalism. Option F says it's a necessary evil. Option J says it's not paternalistic because it's for others, not the individual.

Wait, paternalism is about acting for someone's good, often against their will. So if the reason for prohibition is to protect society, not the individual user, then it's not paternalistic because it's not about the individual's best interest. That would align with option J.

Alternatively, option I says it's about protecting society, but J adds that it's for the benefit of others, not the individual. So J is a bit more precise.

Another angle: If the government is prohibiting drugs to prevent harm to others (like non-users) rather than to protect the users themselves, then it's not paternalistic towards the users. That makes sense because paternalism is about the individual's own good, while public health measures are about the community's good.

So, de Marneffe might argue that drug prohibition isn't paternalistic because it's not about what's best for the individual user but about preventing harm to society. That would make option I or J correct. Between them, J is more precise because it says it's for the benefit of others, not the producers/sellers, so it's not paternalistic in an objectionable way.

I think the correct answer is J.

The correct answer is J. De Marneffe likely argues that drug prohibition is not paternalistic because it aims to protect society from the harmful effects of drugs, rather than acting in the individual's best interest. This distinguishes it from paternalism, which typically involves making decisions for someone's own good, often against their will. 

Answer: J
