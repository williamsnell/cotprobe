Okay, so I have this question about whether the polynomial x² - 12 satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through step by step.

First, what's the Eisenstein criterion? From what I remember, Eisenstein's criterion is a sufficient condition for a polynomial to be irreducible over the rationals, Q. The standard form is that for a polynomial f(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_0, there exists a prime number p such that:

1. p divides all the coefficients except the leading one.
2. p does not divide the leading coefficient.
3. p² does not divide the constant term.

If all these are satisfied, then f(x) is irreducible over Q.

So the given polynomial is x² - 12. Let me write it out: f(x) = x² + 0x -12. The coefficients are 1 (leading), 0, and -12.

I need to check if there's a prime p that satisfies the three conditions.

Condition 1: p divides 0 and -12. Wait, p divides all coefficients except the leading one. The leading coefficient is 1, so p must divide 0 and -12. But 0 is a special case because any prime divides 0. So condition 1 is satisfied if p divides 12.

Condition 2: p does not divide the leading coefficient, which is 1. Since p is a prime, it can't divide 1 because primes are greater than 1. So condition 2 is automatically satisfied.

Condition 3: p² does not divide the constant term, which is -12. So p² should not divide 12.

Let me list the primes that divide 12. The prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3.

Let's check p=2 first. Does p²=4 divide 12? Let's see: 12 divided by 4 is 3, which is an integer, so yes, 4 divides 12. Therefore, condition 3 is not satisfied for p=2 because p² divides the constant term.

Next, p=3. p² is 9. Does 9 divide 12? 12 divided by 9 is 1.333..., which is not an integer. So 9 does not divide 12. Therefore, condition 3 is satisfied for p=3.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. For p=3, condition 1 is that p divides all coefficients except the leading one. The coefficients are 1, 0, -12. So p=3 must divide 0 and -12. 3 divides 0 (yes) and 3 divides 12 (yes). So condition 1 is satisfied. Condition 2 is also satisfied because 3 doesn't divide 1, the leading coefficient. And condition 3 is satisfied because 3²=9 does not divide -12.

So p=3 satisfies all three conditions. That would mean the polynomial is irreducible over Q by Eisenstein's criterion with p=3. But wait, the options given don't have G as the answer. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A through J. Option G is "Yes, with p=3." So that should be correct. But wait, wait! Let me think again. I might be making a mistake here because the standard Eisenstein applies when the polynomial has integer coefficients, which it does here.

Wait, but sometimes people shift the polynomial by substituting x with x + a to apply Eisenstein. But in this case, maybe it's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the polynomial x² -12 could be reducible because it's a quadratic. Let me see: does x² -12 factor into linear factors over Q? Well, x² -12 = (x - sqrt(12))(x + sqrt(12)). But sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), which is irrational, so the polynomial is irreducible over Q because it doesn't factor into linear terms with rational coefficients.

Wait, but Eisenstein's criterion would have told us that it's irreducible. So in this case, the polynomial is irreducible, and Eisenstein's applies with p=3.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I've heard that Eisenstein's criterion is tricky for quadratics. Let me make sure I'm not missing a step. Alternatively, perhaps the polynomial can be made to fit Eisenstein's by a substitution.

Wait, in this case, without any substitution, the polynomial is x² -12, and p=3 meets the criteria. So Eisenstein's applies, so the answer should be G: Yes, with p=3.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D says "No, because the polynomial does not satisfy the Eisenstein criterion." But I thought that p=3 does satisfy it. So why would D be correct?

Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me go through the conditions again.

For p=3:

1. Does 3 divide all coefficients except the leading one? Coefficients are 1 (x²), 0 (x), and -12 (constant). So 3 divides 0 and 3 divides 12? Yes, because 12 is 3*4. So condition 1 is met.

2. Does 3 not divide the leading coefficient (1)? Yes.

3. Does 3²=9 not divide the constant term (-12)? 12 divided by 9 is 1.333..., which is not an integer, so yes, 9 does not divide 12.

So all three conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Eisenstein's criterion applies with p=3, which means the polynomial is irreducible over Q.

Wait, but the answer options include G as "Yes, with p=3." So why is that not the correct answer?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question is whether the polynomial satisfies the Eisenstein criterion, not whether it's irreducible. But since the polynomial is irreducible, but does it satisfy Eisenstein's? Yes, with p=3.

But wait, the options are:

A: Yes, with p=4.

B: No, because the polynomial is reducible.

C: Yes, with p=1.

D: No, because the polynomial does not satisfy the Eisenstein criterion.

E: No.

F: Yes, with p=12.

G: Yes, with p=3.

H: Yes, with p=5.

I: Yes, with p=6.

J: Yes, with p=2.

So if the correct answer is G, then the answer should be G. But wait, the initial analysis suggests that, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people might not consider p=3 applicable. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the constant term.

Wait, the constant term is -12. So the absolute value is 12. So p=3, p²=9. 9 does not divide 12, so condition 3 holds.

So the correct answer should be G: Yes, with p=3.

But looking at the options, I see that option D says "No, because the polynomial does not satisfy the Eisenstein criterion." But I think it does satisfy it with p=3. So why is D an option? Maybe the question is whether the polynomial satisfies Eisenstein's criterion as it is, without any substitution. If so, then yes, it does satisfy with p=3.

Wait, but another thought: Eisenstein's criterion applies to polynomials where the leading coefficient is not divisible by p. In this case, the leading coefficient is 1, which is not divisible by any prime, so that's fine. But sometimes, people require that the constant term is divisible by p but not p². Which is the case here for p=3.

So I think the correct answer is G. But let me check the options again. The options include G as "Yes, with p=3." So the correct answer should be G. However, looking back, the options also include B: No, because the polynomial is reducible. But wait, x² -12 is irreducible over Q because its roots are irrational. So B is incorrect.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about whether the polynomial satisfies Eisenstein's criterion. If it does, then the answer is yes with the appropriate p. So in this case, it does satisfy with p=3, so the answer is G.

But looking at the options, option G is indeed present. So I think the correct answer is G.

The polynomial \( x^2 - 12 \) is considered for irreducibility over \( \mathbb{Q} \) using Eisenstein's criterion. The polynomial has coefficients 1 (leading), 0, and -12. For a prime \( p \) to satisfy Eisenstein's criterion:

1. \( p \) must divide all coefficients except the leading one.
2. \( p \) must not divide the leading coefficient.
3. \( p^2 \) must not divide the constant term.

Checking \( p = 3 \):
- \( 3 \) divides 0 and 12 (conditions 1 and 2 satisfied).
- \( 3^2 = 9 \) does not divide 12 (condition 3 satisfied).

Thus, Eisenstein's criterion is satisfied with \( p = 3 \), making the polynomial irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q} \).
