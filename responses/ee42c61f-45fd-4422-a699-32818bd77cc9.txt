Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH of a solution after mixing NaOH and HCl. Both are strong electrolytes, which I remember means they completely dissociate in water. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says that 40 ml of 0.10 M NaOH is added to 10 ml of 0.45 M HCl. I think the first thing I should do is determine how many moles of each are involved because when they react, they'll neutralize each other.

Moles of NaOH: Molarity is moles per liter, so I need to calculate the volume in liters. 40 ml is 0.04 liters. So, moles = Molarity × Volume. That's 0.10 M × 0.04 L = 0.004 moles of NaOH.

Moles of HCl: Similarly, 10 ml is 0.01 liters. Moles = 0.45 M × 0.01 L = 0.0045 moles of HCl.

Wait, so we have 0.004 moles of NaOH and 0.0045 moles of HCl. Since they're both strong acid and base, they'll react completely in a 1:1 ratio. The reaction should be HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O.

So, HCl is in excess here. Let me subtract the moles that react. NaOH has 0.004 moles, so HCl will also react 0.004 moles. That leaves 0.0045 - 0.004 = 0.0005 moles of HCl remaining.

Now, the total volume of the solution is 40 ml + 10 ml = 50 ml, which is 0.05 liters. So the concentration of excess HCl is moles divided by volume: 0.0005 / 0.05 = 0.01 M. 

Since HCl is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate, so the concentration of H+ ions is 0.01 M. To find the pH, I take the negative logarithm of that. pH = -log(0.01) = 2. 

Looking at the options, B is 2. So the answer should be B.

The problem involves mixing NaOH and HCl, both strong electrolytes. Calculate moles of each: NaOH has 0.004 moles, HCl has 0.0045 moles. They react in a 1:1 ratio, leaving 0.0005 moles of excess HCl. The total volume is 50 ml, giving an HCl concentration of 0.01 M. Since HCl is a strong acid, [H+] = 0.01 M, and pH = -log(0.01) = 2.

Answer: B
