Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A witness sees a murder in the park and is called to testify in the criminal case. Can the defense attorney ask her on cross examination about her habit of feeding the pigeons? The defense knows that she was cited several times for illegally feeding the pigeons. Defense counsel tries to ask, "You have a longtime habit of feeding the pigeons, don't you? You have in fact been ticketed several times for feeding pigeons, haven't you, and yet you persisted in doing it, isn't that so?" Will the trial court likely allow the witness to be questioned on these matters?

Options:

A: Yes, because the statement indicates that the witness' attention was always focused on feeding the pigeons.
B: No, because the witness's actions outside of the crime scene have no bearing on their ability to testify.
C: Yes, because the defense has the right to question a witness about any topic.
D: No, because the defense is attempting to discredit the witness in an unrelated matter.
E: No, because a witness can never be asked about personal prior bad acts.
F: Yes, because the act of feeding pigeons could potentially distract the witness from accurately observing the events.
G: No, because the question has no probative value regarding the credibility of the witness or the guilt of the defendant.
H: Yes, because feeding pigeons in the park and persisting in it after being ticketed may show an antisocial trait of the witness.
I: Yes, because it demonstrates a pattern of breaking the law, which may affect the witness's credibility.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with cross-examination of a witness. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a witness saw a murder in the park and is testifying in the case. The defense attorney wants to cross-examine her about her habit of feeding pigeons. They know she's been cited multiple times for illegally feeding them. The defense is asking a series of questions: whether she has a long-time habit of feeding pigeons, whether she's been ticketed, and if she persisted despite the tickets.

I need to figure out if the trial court is likely to allow these questions. The options are from A to I, each giving a different reasoning.

First, I remember that in cross-examination, the defense can ask questions to impeach the witness's credibility. This can include attacking their character for truthfulness. But there are rules about what's admissible.

I think about the Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rule 608, which deals with a witness's character. Under 608(b), a witness's credibility can be attacked by any specific instances of conduct that resulted in a criminal conviction. However, if the conduct didn't result in a conviction, like just being cited, it's not admissible unless it's relevant to the witness's truthfulness.

Wait, but the defense isn't necessarily trying to show a conviction here. They're bringing up the fact that she was cited multiple times for feeding pigeons, which is an illegal act. So, under 608(b), only if there's a conviction can they bring that up. Since she was only cited, maybe it's not a conviction, so it might not be admissible under that rule.

Alternatively, maybe the defense is trying to show that she has a habit of ignoring rules, which could imply she's not trustworthy. But I'm not sure if that's allowed. I think that specific instances of conduct not resulting in a conviction can't generally be used to impeach character unless they're relevant to the witness's ability to testify accurately.

Another angle is whether feeding pigeons is a habit that could have distracted her. If the witness was feeding pigeons, perhaps she was too focused on that and couldn't have seen the murder clearly. But this seems like a stretch because feeding pigeons is a separate activity from observing the crime. Unless the defense is arguing that her habit made her less observant, but I don't think that's a strong argument because the act of feeding pigeons doesn't directly relate to her ability to notice a murder happening.

Wait, but the defense is attacking her credibility by showing she has a habit of breaking the law (feeding pigeons) despite being cited. The idea is that this might show she's someone who doesn't follow rules, making her less credible. But under the rules, unless it's a conviction, it's not admissible for that purpose.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because her attention was focused on feeding pigeons. But does that relate to the crime? Maybe not directly unless she was feeding pigeons at the time of the murder, which isn't stated.

Option B says no because her actions outside the crime scene don't affect her ability to testify. That makes sense because her past actions, unless relevant, shouldn't impact her credibility.

Option C says yes because defense can question about any topic, but that's not correct. There are limits; not every topic is permissible.

Option D says no because the defense is discrediting her in an unrelated matter. This seems on point. Her pigeon-feeding is unrelated to the crime, so it's an improper basis for impeachment.

Option E says no because you can't ask about prior bad acts. But prior bad acts are allowed if they resulted in a conviction, so E might not be entirely accurate.

Option F says yes because feeding pigeons distracts her. Maybe, but unless it's shown she was feeding them during the crime, it's speculative.

Option G says no because the question has no probative value. That could be the case if the questions don't relate to her credibility or the case.

Option H says yes because it shows an antisocial trait. But without a conviction, it's not admissible under 608(b).

Option I says yes because it shows a pattern of breaking the law, affecting credibility. But again, without a conviction, this might not be allowed.

So, putting it together, the defense is trying to bring up prior conduct (feeding pigeons, which is illegal) that didn't result in a conviction. Under Rule 608(b), only conduct resulting in a conviction can be used, so the defense can't bring up the citations. Therefore, the trial court is likely to exclude these questions because they don't relate to her credibility or the case. So the correct answer should be G or D.

Wait, between D and G. D says the defense is attempting to discredit in an unrelated matter. G says the question has no probative value. I think G is more accurate because the questions don't have probative value regarding the witness's credibility or the guilt of the defendant. They're just irrelevant.

The defense attorney is attempting to cross-examine the witness about her habit of feeding pigeons, for which she has been cited multiple times. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 608(b), a witness's credibility can only be attacked using specific instances of conduct that resulted in a criminal conviction. Since the witness was only cited and not convicted, the defense cannot use this information to impeach her credibility. Additionally, the questions about feeding pigeons do not bear on her ability to testify accurately or the guilt of the defendant, making them irrelevant. Therefore, the trial court is likely to exclude these questions as they lack probative value.

Answer: G
