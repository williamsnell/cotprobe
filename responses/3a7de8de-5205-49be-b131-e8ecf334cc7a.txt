Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Seizing me, he led me down to the House of Darkness…
To the house where those who enter do not come out,
Along the road of no return,
To the house where those who dwell, do without light,
Where dirt is their drink, their food is of clay…
Where light cannot be seen. They dwell in the dark,
And upon the door and bolt, there lies dust.
from Tablet VII, The Epic of Gilgamesh, Sumeria, ca. 2100 B.C.E.
Truth is good and its worth is lasting.
It has not been disturbed since the day of its creator,
Whereas he who transgresses its ordinances is punished.
It lies as a path in front of even him who knows nothing.
Wrongdoing has never yet brought its venture to port…
Those whom the gods guide cannot lose themselves.
Those to whom they forbid passage will not be able to cross the river of life.
from The Maxims of Ptahhotep, Egypt, ca. 2400 B.C.E.

Okay, so I have this question about two ancient texts and which conclusion they support. Let me take it step by step.

First, the question provides two excerpts from ancient literature. The first is from Tablet VII of The Epic of Gilgamesh, which is Sumerian and dates back to around 2100 B.C.E. The passage describes the "House of Darkness," which sounds like a place of doom. It talks about people not coming out, the road of no return, living without light, and dust on the door and bolt. This makes me think it's describing the afterlife or a dark, gloomy place where the dead reside. So, the Sumerian text seems pretty negative about the afterlife.

The second excerpt is from The Maxims of Ptahhotep, an Egyptian text from around 2400 B.C.E. It talks about truth being good, lasting, and that wrongdoing doesn't bring success. It also mentions that those guided by the gods can't lose themselves, and those forbidden passage can't cross the river of life. This seems more about moral guidance and the consequences of actions, perhaps relating to an afterlife where righteousness is rewarded. It doesn't sound as dark as the Sumerian text. Instead, it suggests that following truth and justice leads to a positive outcome, maybe a favorable afterlife.

Now, the question is asking which conclusion best supports these two texts. The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Sumerians had a darker perspective than Egyptians. From the texts, the Sumerian text is definitely darker, talking about a gloomy afterlife, while the Egyptian text seems more about moral guidelines and positive outcomes. So this could be a possible conclusion.

Option B: Sumerians focused more on physical aspects. The Sumerian text is about the afterlife, which is more spiritual, not physical. The Egyptian text also deals with moral and spiritual things, so this might not be the best fit.

Option C: Egyptians viewed afterlife as punishment more than Sumerians. Wait, the Sumerian text describes a dark, punishing afterlife, while the Egyptian text seems to focus on moral guidelines but doesn't explicitly say the afterlife is a punishment. In fact, Egyptian afterlife concepts, like the Book of the Dead, often involve judgment but also the hope of a good afterlife if you're justified. So maybe the Egyptian text here isn't indicating a punitive afterlife, making C less likely.

Option D: Egyptians were more spiritual. Both texts deal with spiritual themes, but the Egyptian text emphasizes truth and moral behavior leading to a positive outcome, which might suggest a more structured spiritual belief system. But I'm not sure if this is the best conclusion.

Option E: Sumerians had a more positive view of afterlife than Egyptians. No, the opposite seems true. The Sumerian text is negative, while the Egyptian text is more positive or at least not as negative.

Option F: Egyptians had less gloomy views than Sumerians. Yes, the Sumerian text is gloomy, the Egyptian seems more about moral consequences but not necessarily less gloomy. Wait, the Egyptian text doesn't describe the afterlife as dark; it's more about behavior leading to success. So maybe the Egyptian view is less gloomy.

Option G: Egyptians more optimistic about afterlife. If the Egyptian text implies that following truth leads to a good afterlife, that's optimistic. The Sumerian text is pessimistic. So G could be a good option.

Option H: Egyptians had more rigid social hierarchy. The texts don't talk about social structures, so H is probably not related.

Option I: Egyptians viewed political obedience as morally proper. The Egyptian text talks about truth and wrongdoing, not directly about political obedience, so I don't think this is supported.

Option J: Egyptians were more patriarchal. The texts don't address gender roles, so J is out.

So narrowing down, the key points are the afterlife descriptions. Sumerian is negative, Egyptian is more positive or at least not as dark. So looking at the options, F says Egyptians had a less gloomy view, G says Egyptians were more optimistic.

Which is it? The Sumerian text is clearly about a dark, gloomy afterlife. The Egyptian text, while not describing the afterlife directly, talks about truth guiding people and the consequences of actions, which might suggest that a moral life leads to a favorable afterlife, making their view more optimistic.

So the conclusion is that the Egyptian view of the afterlife was less gloomy or more optimistic than the Sumerian. Looking at the options, F and G are about this. The question is whether the Egyptian text supports a less gloomy view (F) or more optimistic (G). 

Wait, the Egyptian text doesn't explicitly talk about the afterlife in the excerpt provided. It's more about truth and moral behavior leading to not losing oneself and being able to cross the river of life. The river might be a metaphor for the afterlife, perhaps implying that if you follow truth, you can successfully navigate it, which is positive. So the Egyptian perspective here seems more positive or optimistic about the afterlife compared to the Sumerian, which is clearly negative.

So the conclusion would be that the Egyptian afterlife view was less gloomy or more optimistic. Looking at options, F says "less gloomy," G says "more optimistic." Both could be correct, but in the options, F is "less gloomy" and G is "more optimistic."

Wait, the Sumerian text is gloomy about the afterlife, the Egyptian text's excerpt doesn't talk about the afterlife but about moral behavior and consequences. So perhaps the Egyptian text supports a more positive view of the afterlife, but since the excerpt doesn't directly describe it, maybe we have to infer based on the available info.

Alternatively, perhaps the Egyptian text's focus on truth and moral behavior implies that the afterlife is a reward for such behavior, making it more optimistic. So G would be the conclusion: Egyptians were more optimistic about life after death.

Wait, but the options are about what the two texts support. The Sumerian text is negative, the Egyptian text is more about moral behavior leading to a positive outcome, possibly in the afterlife. So the Egyptian text suggests a more positive view, making G correct.

So the best answer is F or G. Wait, let me check the options again.

Option F: Ancient Egyptians had a less gloomy view of the afterlife than ancient Sumerians.

Option G: Ancient Egyptians were more optimistic about life after death than ancient Sumerians.

Both F and G seem correct, but perhaps F is about being less gloomy, which is true if the Egyptian view isn't as dark as Sumerian. G is about being more optimistic, which is also true if the Egyptian text implies a positive afterlife.

But looking at the question, the Sumerian text is about the House of Darkness, which is gloomy. The Egyptian text talks about truth and moral behavior leading to not losing oneself and being able to cross the river of life. The river could be the Nile, and in Egyptian belief, the afterlife was a continuation, perhaps in a field on the other side. But the text doesn't explicitly say, but the idea that following truth leads to a successful crossing might imply a positive afterlife.

So the Egyptian text seems more optimistic, making G correct. Alternatively, F is also correct in that they are less gloomy.

But the question is about which conclusion the two texts best support. Since the Sumerian text is gloomy, and the Egyptian text is not, but the Egyptian text is positive in its approach, the best conclusion is that the Egyptians had a less gloomy or more optimistic view.

Looking at the options, both F and G are possibilities. But the options are distinct: F is less gloomy, G is more optimistic. The Egyptian text supports both, but perhaps the better fit is F, as the Egyptian text doesn't explicitly talk about the afterlife in a positive way, but the Sumerian is clearly negative. So the Egyptian's view is less gloomy, making F correct.

Wait, but the Egyptian text is about truth leading to not losing oneself and being able to cross the river, which could relate to the afterlife positively. So perhaps the Egyptian view is more optimistic, making G correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn, but I think G is the better answer because the Egyptian text suggests that following truth leads to a positive outcome, which implies optimism about the afterlife. So the answer would be G.

The two texts provide contrasting perspectives on life and the afterlife. The Sumerian text from *The Epic of Gilgamesh* describes the "House of Darkness" as a gloomy, irreversible destination, emphasizing a negative view of the afterlife. In contrast, the Egyptian text from *The Maxims of Ptahhotep* focuses on the importance of truth and moral behavior, suggesting that following these principles leads to a positive outcome, possibly in the afterlife. This implies a more optimistic view of the afterlife compared to the Sumerian perspective. 

Analyzing the options, both F and G are plausible, as the Egyptian text is less gloomy and more optimistic. However, the stronger conclusion is that the Egyptians were more optimistic about life after death, as the text emphasizes the rewards of righteousness, aligning with option G.

Answer: G
