Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about a plane wave traveling in a medium, and I need to find the conduction current density, displacement current density, and total current density. Let me see what I remember from my electromagnetics classes.

The given data is:
- Frequency, f = 1590 MHz. Hmm, that's pretty high, so the wavelength must be really short. But wait, the medium has μ_r = ε_r = 1, which means it's non-magnetic and non-dispersive, probably similar to vacuum or air. Oh, but wait, σ (conductivity) is 0.1 mho/m. So it's a conductor but not a perfect one because σ isn't infinite. So this medium is a good conductor but has some resistance.

The electric field intensity E is given as 10 V/m. Wait, but in a wave, E and H are usually phasors, but the question just says E is 10 V/m. I think in this context, it's the peak value or maybe the RMS? Well, I'll assume it's the peak value because when we calculate current densities, we usually deal with peak values unless specified otherwise.

Let me tackle each part step by step.

(a) Conduction current density (Jc):
I remember that conduction current density Jc is given by Ohm's law in point form: Jc = σ * E. Since E is 10 V/m and σ is 0.1 S/m, then Jc = 0.1 * 10 = 1 Amp/m². So that's part (a).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check the (a) values. Option D has (a) 1 Amp/m², which matches my calculation. So that's a good sign.

(b) Displacement current density (Jd):
Displacement current is given by Jd = ε * (dE/dt), but since E is a sinusoidal wave, we can express it as E = E₀ sin(ωt + φ). Then dE/dt = ω E₀ cos(ωt + φ). So Jd becomes ε E₀ ω cos(ωt + φ).

Wait, but in phasor form, displacement current is represented as Jd = jω ε E. Alternatively, using the peak values, Jd_peak = ω ε E₀.

Wait, but since the medium has ε_r = 1, ε = ε₀. So let me compute ω first. Frequency f is 1590 MHz, which is 1.59e9 Hz. So ω = 2πf = 2 * π * 1.59e9 ≈ 3.18e10 rad/s.

Then Jd_peak = ω ε₀ E₀. Wait, E₀ is 10 V/m. So Jd = ω * ε₀ * E₀.

Wait, ε₀ is 8.85e-12 F/m. So let me compute that: 3.18e10 * 8.85e-12 * 10.

Let me compute step by step:
3.18e10 * 8.85e-12 = (3.18 * 8.85) * 1e-2 ≈ 28.167 * 0.01 ≈ 0.28167.

Multiply by 10 (E₀) gives 2.8167 Amp/m². Hmm, but looking at the options, none of the (b) parts have a value around 2.8. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in phasor form, displacement current is Jd = jω ε E, but since E is given as 10 V/m, perhaps that's the RMS value, not the peak. Wait, no, the problem says E is 10 V/m, but I'm not sure if it's peak or RMS. Maybe I should reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using E as the peak value, and displacement current uses the peak as well. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor because the wave is sinusoidal, and the average displacement current is zero. But the question is asking for the displacement current density, which would be time-varying. So perhaps we should express it as a function of time.

Wait, another approach: The displacement current density Jd is given by Jd = ε * dE/dt. So dE/dt is the time derivative of E. Since E is a sinusoidal function, E = E₀ sin(ωt + φ), then dE/dt = E₀ ω cos(ωt + φ). So Jd = ε E₀ ω cos(ωt + φ).

But in the options, the displacement current is given as a sinusoidal function. For example, option D's (b) is 0.883 sin(ωt + π/2) A/m². Let me see what that evaluates to.

Wait, sin(θ + π/2) is equal to cosθ. So 0.883 sin(ωt + π/2) is 0.883 cos(ωt). But according to our earlier calculation, Jd_peak should be ω ε₀ E₀. Let me compute that again.

ω = 2π * 1.59e9 ≈ 3.18e10 rad/s.

ε₀ = 8.85e-12 F/m.

E₀ =10 V/m.

So Jd_peak = ω * ε₀ * E₀ = 3.18e10 * 8.85e-12 * 10.

Compute 3.18e10 * 8.85e-12:

3.18e10 = 31,800,000,000

8.85e-12 = 0.00000000000885

Multiply them: 31,800,000,000 * 0.00000000000885 = ?

Let me compute 31.8e9 * 8.85e-12 = 31.8 * 8.85e-3 = ?

31.8 * 8.85 = let's compute 30*8.85=265.5, 1.8*8.85=15.93, total 281.43. Then 281.43e-3 = 0.28143.

Multiply by 10 (E₀) gives 2.8143 A/m². So Jd_peak ≈ 2.814 A/m².

But looking at the options, I don't see any (b) parts with 2.8. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in calculation? Or perhaps I should consider that E is RMS instead of peak.

Wait, if E is given as RMS, then the peak E would be E_peak = E_rms * sqrt(2). But the problem didn't specify, so I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the medium's relative permittivity and permeability being 1, but since σ is non-zero, it's a good conductor. So displacement current would be less significant compared to conduction current, but in the options, Jd is much smaller than Jc. Wait, in our earlier calculation, Jd was around 2.81 A/m², but in option D, (b) is 0.883 sin(ωt + π/2), which is about 0.883 A/m². That's much lower than my calculation.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula. Displacement current density Jd is ε * dE/dt. Since ε = ε₀ * ε_r, which is ε₀ * 1 = ε₀.

So Jd = ε₀ * dE/dt.

But E is 10 V/m, but I'm not sure if it's the peak or RMS. If E is the RMS value, then the peak E would be 10 * sqrt(2), which is about 14.14 V/m. Then Jd_peak = ω * ε₀ * E_peak.

Wait, let me compute that. ω = 3.18e10 rad/s, E_peak = 10 * sqrt(2) ≈ 14.14 V/m.

So Jd_peak = 3.18e10 * 8.85e-12 * 14.14.

Compute 3.18e10 * 8.85e-12 = 0.28143 as before. Multiply by 14.14 gives ~3.98 A/m². Still not matching any options.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using E as the phasor value, so Jd would be jω ε E. But without knowing the phase, perhaps it's given as a sinusoidal function.

Wait, another thought: the displacement current is given by Jd = ε₀ ω E_peak. So E_peak is 10 V/m, so Jd_peak = ε₀ * ω * 10.

Earlier, that gave me approximately 2.814 A/m². But the options for (b) don't include this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, looking at option D again: (b) 0.883 sin(ωt + π/2) Amp/m². Let me compute Jd_peak from this. The amplitude is 0.883 A/m². So if Jd_peak is 0.883 A/m², then 0.883 = ε₀ * ω * E_peak.

Let me compute ε₀ * ω: 8.85e-12 * 3.18e10 ≈ 2.816e-1. So 0.2816. Then E_peak = Jd_peak / (ε₀ * ω) = 0.883 / 0.2816 ≈ 3.135 V/m. But the given E is 10 V/m, so that doesn't match. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Since the medium is lossy (σ=0.1), the wave will have both conduction and displacement currents.

The wave is propagating, so the total current density J is the sum of Jc and Jd.

But wait, in a plane wave, Jc is σ E, and Jd is ε₀ ω E. So in phasor form, J_total = Jc + Jd = σ E + jω ε₀ E.

But wait, E is a phasor, so J_total = (σ + jω ε₀) E.

Wait, but in this case, E is given as 10 V/m, but is it the phasor or the time-varying? I'm assuming it's the peak value of the phasor.

So for part (a), Jc = σ E = 0.1 * 10 = 1 A/m². That matches option D's (a) value.

For part (b), Jd = jω ε₀ E. So the peak value would be ω ε₀ E, which is the same as before, about 2.814 A/m². But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that displacement current density is given by Jd = ε * (dE/dt). Since E is sinusoidal, dE/dt is ω E cos(ωt + φ). So in time domain, Jd = ε₀ ω E cos(ωt + φ). So for the peak, it's ε₀ ω E.

Wait, but with E=10 V/m, that gives Jd_peak ≈ 2.814 A/m². But in option D, (b) is 0.883 sin(ωt + π/2), which is 0.883 cos(ωt). So the peak is 0.883 A/m², which is much less than my calculation.

This suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, another thought: The displacement current density Jd is ε * (dE/dt). But in a plane wave, the E and H fields are related. The intrinsic impedance η = sqrt(μ/ε). Since μ_r=ε_r=1, η = η₀ = 377 ohms.

Wait, but with conductivity σ, the wave's propagation is affected, but for current densities, perhaps we can proceed as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the impedance of the medium. The complex impedance Z is given by Z = η + jη tanθ, but for a plane wave, θ is the angle of propagation, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the current densities can be calculated using the phasor forms. So Jc = σ E, and Jd = jω ε E.

So in terms of phasors, Jc is 0.1 * 10 = 1 A/m². Jd is jω ε₀ * 10.

Compute ω ε₀: 3.18e10 * 8.85e-12 ≈ 0.2816. So jω ε₀ E is j0.2816 *10 = j2.816 A/m². So Jd in phasor form is j2.816 A/m².

So the total current density J_total = Jc + Jd = 1 + j2.816 A/m². But looking at the options, none of them have this. The closest is option D, which has (c) (1 + j0.88) A/m². But 0.88 is much less than 2.816.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Jd. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the displacement current more accurately. Let me recompute ω*ε₀*E.

ω = 2πf = 2π*1.59e9 ≈ 3.18e10 rad/s.

ε₀ = 8.85e-12 F/m.

E = 10 V/m.

So ω ε₀ E = 3.18e10 * 8.85e-12 * 10.

Compute step by step:

3.18e10 * 8.85e-12 = (3.18 * 8.85) * 1e-2.

3.18 * 8.85 ≈ 28.167.

So 28.167e-2 = 0.28167.

Multiply by 10 (E) gives 2.8167 A/m².

So Jd_peak is approximately 2.8167 A/m².

But none of the options have this value for (b). So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D's (a) is 1 A/m², which matches Jc. But (b) is 0.883 sin(ωt + π/2), which is 0.883 cos(ωt). So that would imply Jd_peak is 0.883 A/m². But that's much lower than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that E is the RMS value instead of peak. Let me try that.

If E is 10 V/m RMS, then E_peak = 10 * sqrt(2) ≈ 14.142 V/m.

Then Jd_peak = ω ε₀ E_peak = 3.18e10 * 8.85e-12 * 14.142.

Compute:

3.18e10 *8.85e-12 = 0.28167.

0.28167 *14.142 ≈ 3.98 A/m².

Still, none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relationship between E and the currents differently. Since the wave is propagating in a medium with conductivity, the total current is the sum of conduction and displacement currents.

Another approach: The conduction current density Jc is σ E, and the displacement current density Jd is ε₀ ω E. So in phasor form, J_total = (σ + jω ε₀) E.

But when you take the magnitude, |J_total| = sqrt( (σ E)^2 + (ω ε₀ E)^2 ).

But perhaps the question is expecting the phasor components, so Jc is real, and Jd is imaginary.

Wait, looking at the options, option D's (c) is (1 + j0.88) A/m². So Jc=1, Jd=0.88 j.

But according to my earlier calculation, Jd should be about 2.81, not 0.88. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute ω ε₀ correctly. Let me check:

ω = 2π * 1590e6 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 1.59e9 ≈ 1.59e9 * 6.2832 ≈ 9.999e9 ≈ 1e10 rad/s. Wait, more accurately, 2π*1.59e9 ≈ 3.18e10 rad/s.

ε₀ = 8.85e-12 F/m.

So ω ε₀ = 3.18e10 * 8.85e-12 ≈ (3.18 *8.85) *1e-2 ≈ 28.167 * 0.01 ≈ 0.28167 s^-1.

Multiply by E=10 V/m: 0.28167 *10 ≈ 2.8167 A/m².

But option D's (b) is 0.883 sin(ωt + π/2), which is 0.883 cos(ωt). So the amplitude is 0.883 A/m², which is much less than 2.8167.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the wave is traveling in a medium with σ, and perhaps the displacement current is reduced by some factor. Or perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Alternatively, perhaps the given E is the RMS value, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The conduction current is Jc = σ E, and the displacement current is Jd = ε₀ ω E. But in a medium with conductivity, the wave's phase velocity and other properties change, but I don't think that affects the current densities directly.

Wait, perhaps the given E is the phasor value, so in that case, Jd = jω ε₀ E. So the displacement current density would be j times a real number, which is the imaginary part of the total current.

So if E is 10 V/m (peak), then Jc = 1 A/m², and Jd = j2.8167 A/m². So the total current density J = 1 + j2.8167 A/m². But none of the options have this.

Wait, looking at option D, (c) is (1 + j0.88) A/m². So Jd is 0.88 j, but according to my calculation, it should be about 2.8167 j.

This suggests that perhaps the given E is RMS, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the displacement current to be negligible compared to the conduction current, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ω. Let me check again. f =1590 MHz = 1.59e9 Hz.

ω = 2πf = 2 * 3.1416 * 1.59e9 ≈ 3.18e10 rad/s. That's correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the medium's relative permittivity and permeability are 1, but the wave's impedance affects the displacement current. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given E is the RMS value, and I should calculate the peak displacement current accordingly.

If E is RMS, then E_peak = E_rms * sqrt(2) ≈ 10 *1.414 ≈14.14 V/m.

Then Jd_peak = ω ε₀ E_peak ≈3.18e10 *8.85e-12 *14.14 ≈3.18e10 * 8.85e-12=0.28167, *14.14= ~3.98 A/m².

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the displacement current density to be expressed in terms of the given frequency and E, but maybe I'm supposed to use the wave's properties differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the displacement current density is given by Jd = ε E * ω, which would be the same as what I did earlier.

Wait, but looking at option D's (b): 0.883 sin(ωt + π/2) A/m². Let me compute what 0.883 is in terms of ω ε₀ E.

0.883 = ω ε₀ E. So E = 0.883 / (ω ε₀).

ω ε₀ =3.18e10 *8.85e-12 ≈0.28167.

So E=0.883 /0.28167 ≈3.135 V/m. But the given E is 10 V/m, so that doesn't match. So perhaps option D isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (a). Let me double-check. Jc = σ E =0.1 *10=1 A/m². Yes, that's correct.

So part (a) is definitely 1 A/m², which matches option D's (a).

Now, looking at the options, only option D has (a)=1. So perhaps I'm missing something in part (b).

Wait, maybe the displacement current density is given by Jd = ε * (dE/dt), and since E is 10 V/m, perhaps it's the instantaneous value, not the peak. But that doesn't make sense because the current density would vary with time.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using E as the RMS value, but then I'd have to adjust my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in a lossy medium, the wave's amplitude is attenuated, but that's more about the propagation constant than the current density.

Alternatively, perhaps the given E is the peak value, and I should use Jd = ε₀ ω E sin(ωt + φ), but that would make Jd a time-varying quantity, which matches the options given.

Wait, but in that case, the amplitude of Jd would be ε₀ ω E, which is about 2.8167 A/m², as before. But none of the options have that.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the given E is the RMS value, so E_peak = E_rms * sqrt(2) ≈10 *1.414=14.14 V/m.

Then Jd_peak = ω ε₀ *14.14 ≈3.18e10 *8.85e-12 *14.14≈3.98 A/m².

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where Jd is around 2.8 A/m². Looking at the options, I don't see any. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: The displacement current density Jd can also be expressed as Jd = ε₀ E * (d/dt)(E × something). Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the wave's properties.

Wait, in a plane wave, the relationship between E and H is E = η H, where η is the intrinsic impedance. η = sqrt(μ/ε) = sqrt(μ_r μ₀ / (ε_r ε₀)) = sqrt(1/(1)) * η₀ = η₀ = 377 ohms.

So H = E / η = 10 / 377 ≈0.0265 A/m.

But how does that help with current densities? Hmm.

Wait, the displacement current density Jd is given by Jd = ε₀ * (dE/dt). So if E = E₀ sin(ωt), then dE/dt = E₀ ω cos(ωt). So Jd = ε₀ E₀ ω cos(ωt).

In this case, E₀ is 10 V/m, so Jd = ε₀ *10 *3.18e10 * cos(ωt).

Which is Jd = (8.85e-12) *10 *3.18e10 * cos(ωt).

Calculating that: 8.85e-12 * 10 =8.85e-11.

8.85e-11 *3.18e10 ≈ (8.85 *3.18) *1e-1 ≈28.167 *0.1=2.8167.

So Jd = 2.8167 cos(ωt) A/m².

So the displacement current density is 2.8167 cos(ωt) A/m², which can also be written as 2.8167 sin(ωt + π/2) A/m².

But none of the options have this value. The closest is option D's (b), which is 0.883 sin(ωt + π/2), but that's about a third of what I calculated.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Compute ε₀ * ω * E:

8.85e-12 F/m * 3.18e10 rad/s *10 V/m.

So 8.85e-12 *3.18e10 =8.85 *3.18 *1e-2 =28.167 *0.01=0.28167.

Multiply by 10 gives 2.8167 A/m².

Yes, that's correct. So Jd_peak is 2.8167 A/m².

But none of the options have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the given E is the RMS value, but I'm not sure. Let me try that.

If E is 10 V/m RMS, then E_peak =10 * sqrt(2) ≈14.14 V/m.

Then Jd_peak = ε₀ * ω *14.14 ≈8.85e-12 *3.18e10 *14.14.

Compute step by step:

8.85e-12 *3.18e10 =0.28167.

0.28167 *14.14≈3.98 A/m².

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the given E is the peak value, and I should proceed as before.

In that case, Jd is 2.8167 A/m², which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D's (b) is 0.883 sin(ωt + π/2), which is 0.883 cos(ωt). So Jd_peak is 0.883 A/m². Let me see if that makes sense.

If Jd_peak =0.883, then ε₀ * ω * E =0.883.

E =0.883 / (ε₀ * ω) =0.883 / (8.85e-12 *3.18e10).

Compute denominator:8.85e-12 *3.18e10≈0.28167.

So E=0.883 /0.28167≈3.135 V/m.

But the given E is 10 V/m, so this doesn't make sense. So perhaps option D isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the displacement current density is given by Jd = ε * (dE/dt), and in the problem, E is given as 10 V/m, but perhaps it's the RMS value. Let me try that.

If E is 10 V/m RMS, then E_peak =10 *sqrt(2)=14.142 V/m.

Then Jd_peak = ε₀ *ω *14.142 ≈8.85e-12 *3.18e10 *14.142 ≈3.98 A/m².

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I must have made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not seeing why.

Wait, perhaps the displacement current density is being expressed as a phasor, and the question is considering the phase shift between E and Jd.

Wait, Jd = jω ε₀ E, so the phase is 90 degrees ahead of E. So if E is in phase with Jc, then Jd is leading by 90 degrees.

Looking at the options, option D's (b) is 0.883 sin(ωt + π/2), which is a phase lead of 90 degrees. So that matches the expected phase shift.

But the amplitude is still off. So perhaps the correct answer is D, and I'm missing a factor somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the given E is not the peak but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the wave's impedance includes the conductivity, affecting the displacement current. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, another thought: The total current density J is J = Jc + Jd = σ E + jω ε₀ E.

So J = (σ + jω ε₀) E.

The magnitude of J is sqrt(σ² + (ω ε₀)^2) * E.

But perhaps the question is looking for the phasor form, which would be J = (σ + jω ε₀) E.

In that case, for part (c), the total current density would be (1 + j2.8167) A/m². But none of the options have that.

Looking at the options, option D's (c) is (1 + j0.88) A/m². So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Jd.

Wait, perhaps I should compute Jd as ε₀ * ω * E * sin(ωt + π/2), but that doesn't change the amplitude.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Given that part (a) is correct for option D, and the phase of (b) matches, perhaps the correct answer is D, and I'm miscalculating Jd.

Alternatively, perhaps the given E is the RMS value, and I should use that in the calculation.

Wait, let me try that. If E is 10 V/m RMS, then E_peak =10 *sqrt(2)=14.142 V/m.

Then Jd_peak = ε₀ * ω *14.142 ≈8.85e-12 *3.18e10 *14.142 ≈3.98 A/m².

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the displacement current density is given by Jd = ε₀ E *ω, but with E being RMS. So Jd_peak = ε₀ E_rms * ω * sqrt(2).

Wait, that would be Jd_peak = ε₀ *10 *3.18e10 *1.414 ≈8.85e-12 *10 *3.18e10 *1.414.

Compute:

8.85e-12 *10 =8.85e-11.

8.85e-11 *3.18e10= 8.85*3.18 *1e-1 ≈28.167 *0.1=2.8167.

Multiply by 1.414: 2.8167 *1.414≈3.98 A/m².

Still not matching any options.

I'm really not sure where I'm going wrong. Given that, I'll have to go with the option that matches part (a) and the phase of part (b), which is option D.

The problem involves determining the conduction current density, displacement current density, and total current density for a plane wave in a medium with given properties. The frequency is 1590 MHz, the medium has \(\mu_r = \epsilon_r = 1\), and \(\sigma = 0.1 \, \text{mho/m}\). The electric field intensity \(E\) is 10 V/m.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Conduction Current Density (\(J_c\)):**
   Using Ohm's law, \(J_c = \sigma E = 0.1 \times 10 = 1 \, \text{A/m}^2\). This matches option D's part (a).

2. **Displacement Current Density (\(J_d\)):**
   The displacement current density is given by \(J_d = \epsilon_0 \omega E\), where \(\omega = 2\pi f = 3.18 \times 10^{10} \, \text{rad/s}\) and \(\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m}\). Substituting, \(J_d = (8.85 \times 10^{-12})(3.18 \times 10^{10})(10) \approx 2.8167 \, \text{A/m}^2\). However, none of the options match this value. Option D's part (b) is \(0.883 \sin(\omega t + \pi/2) \, \text{A/m}^2\), which corresponds to a peak displacement current density of \(0.883 \, \text{A/m}^2\). This discrepancy suggests a possible mismatch in assumptions or given values.

3. **Total Current Density (\(J_{\text{total}}\)):**
   The total current density is the sum of conduction and displacement currents: \(J_{\text{total}} = J_c + J_d = 1 + j2.8167 \, \text{A/m}^2\). However, option D's part (c) is \((1 + j0.88) \, \text{A/m}^2\), which does not match the calculated value. Despite this, option D is the only one where part (a) matches and the phase of part (b) aligns with the expected displacement current phase.

### Conclusion:
Given the calculations and the provided options, the most consistent choice is **option D**, despite discrepancies in the displacement current density value.

**Answer: D**
