Question:

A man placed the following advertisement in his local newspaper:"Public Auction Sale . . . without reserve December 7, 10:00 a. m. 110 Walnut St. , City, StateEntire furnishings of home must go: antiques, piano, pool table, appliances, tables, stereo system, etc. "On the morning of December 7, a group of approximately 20 people showed up at the man's home. The first item the man put up for bid was an antique Baldwin grand piano. The man announced that the bidding would be "without reserve" and said, "What's the opening bid on this beautiful Baldwin grand piano?" A woman opened the bidding with $100. The man then commented, "This piano is worth at least $5,000. What other bids am I offered?" When the man did not receive any other bids, he informed the woman that he would not accept $100 and was removing the piano from the sale. If the woman asserts an action against the man for breach of contract, the woman will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the auctioneer asked for other bids after the woman's opening bid, validating her bid.
B: prevail, because whether or not the auction is "without reserve," goods cannot be withdrawn after the auctioneer calls for bids.
C: not prevail, because at an auction "without reserve," the auctioneer may withdraw goods until he announces completion of the sale.
D: not prevail, because the auctioneer did not formally accept the woman's bid before withdrawing the piano.
E: not prevail, because at an auction "without reserve," the auctioneer invites offers, which he may accept or reject.
F: prevail, because the auctioneer stated that the piano is worth at least $5,000, implying a minimum bid.
G: not prevail, because the auctioneer has the discretion to withdraw any item from an auction.
H: prevail, because goods put up at an auction "without reserve" may not be withdrawn.
I: prevail, because the auction was advertised as "without reserve," meaning all items must be sold to the highest bidder.
J: not prevail, because the auctioneer has the right to reject any bid he considers too low.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out this auction question. So, let's break it down. The scenario is about a man holding a public auction without reserve. He advertised that all his home furnishings, including a Baldwin grand piano, would be sold. On the day, a woman made an opening bid of $100 for the piano. The man then mentioned the piano was worth at least $5,000 and asked for other bids. When no one else bid, he told the woman he wouldn't accept $100 and took the piano out of the sale.

The question is whether the woman can sue for breach of contract. The options are A through J, each giving a reason.

First, I need to remember the rules about auctions, especially "without reserve." In a "without reserve" auction, the seller isn't obligated to accept any bid; they can keep the item if they don't like the bids. But once a bid is made and the seller accepts it, then it's a contract. If the seller withdraws the item before accepting a bid, maybe that's different.

In this case, the woman opened with $100, and the seller asked for more bids. So he didn't accept her bid yet. He was trying to see if someone else would bid higher. Since no one did, he decided not to accept $100. So legally, did he have the right to do that?

I think at an auction without reserve, the seller can keep the item if they don't get a satisfactory bid. So the woman's $100 wasn't accepted, and the seller withdrew the piano. That probably means there's no contract, so she can't sue for breach. 

Looking at the options, option C says she won't prevail because in a "without reserve" auction, the seller can withdraw goods until he announces the sale is completed. That makes sense because the auctioneer can keep the item if no better bids come in.

Option D says she doesn't prevail because the auctioneer didn't formally accept her bid. That's also true, but the main reason is the "without reserve" aspect. Option J says the auctioneer can reject any bid he considers too low, which is another way of looking at it.

So the correct answer would likely be C or J, but C seems to explain the general principle better. The key is that without reserve auctions allow the seller to withdraw items until the sale is concluded.

The correct answer is C: not prevail, because at an auction "without reserve," the auctioneer may withdraw goods until he announces completion of the sale.
