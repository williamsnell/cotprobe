Okay, so I have this question about South Sudan's electricity access in 2016. I'm a bit unsure, but let me think through it. I remember that South Sudan is a relatively new country and has faced a lot of challenges, especially in infrastructure. So, I'm guessing their electricity access isn't very high.

I think a lot of African countries have lower access rates, but I'm not exactly sure. I recall that some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have around 20-30% access. South Sudan, being one of the poorest and with ongoing conflicts, might be even lower. 

Wait, I think the World Bank or some report mentioned that around 2016, the electrification rate in South Sudan was quite low. Maybe single digits? So looking at the options, D is 9%, G is 19%. That seems plausible. 

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes reports might include access to both urban and rural areas. In urban centers, maybe it's higher, but rural is way lower. So overall, the average might be around 19% or 9%. I'm not certain. I think I've heard that less than 10% have access, so D (9%) might be the answer. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's higher because some areas have generators or other sources. Hmm, I'm a bit torn between D and G.
