Okay, so I've got this question about a search engine's trend-tracking feature and which question is least likely to be answerable using it. Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to understand what the trend-tracking feature does. From the question, it says it provides information on how popular a search term is and can be filtered by geographic region, date, and category. The categories mentioned are arts and entertainment, computers and electronics, games, news, people and society, shopping, sports, and travel.

The question is asking which of the options (A through D) is least likely to be answerable using this feature. So I need to evaluate each option and see if the trend data can provide the necessary information.

Option A: "In which political candidates are people interested?" Hmm, political candidates fall under the 'people and society' category. The trends feature can show how popular each candidate's search terms are. So it should be possible to determine which candidates are more searched, hence more interested.

Option B: "Which region of the country has the greatest number of people searching for opera performances?" Opera performances are under 'arts and entertainment'. The feature allows filtering by geographic region, so we can see which region has higher search volumes for opera. That should be answerable.

Option C: "What is the cost of a certain electronics product?" Now, the category here is 'computers and electronics'. The trend data can show how often people search for that product, but it doesn't provide information on prices. Search trends don't include pricing data, so this might be the one that's not answerable.

Option D: "In what month does a particular sport receive the most searches?" Sports are covered under the 'sports' category. The feature can filter by date, so we can analyze monthly search trends to find out when the sport is most popular. That should be possible.

So putting it all together, the least likely question would be about the cost of an electronics product because the trend data doesn't provide pricing information. It only shows popularity, not prices.

The answer is C.

The trend-tracking feature provides data on search term popularity but does not include pricing information, making it unable to answer questions about costs.

Answer: C
