Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about what is NOT one of the most rewarding aspects of being a grandparent. I need to figure out which option doesn't fit. Let me go through each option one by one.

First, option A is "Sharing wisdom and life experiences." I think that's definitely a positive aspect because grandparents often love giving advice and sharing their knowledge with the younger generation. So A is probably a rewarding part.

Option B is "Having a second chance at parenting." This makes sense because grandparents might get to teach their children's kids, which can give them a new perspective on parenting without the same responsibilities. So B is likely a rewarding aspect.

C is "Watching grandchildren grow and develop." That sounds very rewarding as seeing their growth must be fulfilling. So C is definitely a positive aspect.

D is "Having others to wait on you." Hmm, this one seems a bit off. Grandparents might enjoy being respected and taken care of, but is that one of the most rewarding aspects? It feels more like a benefit rather than something they find rewarding. I'm not sure yet, but I'll keep it in mind.

E is "Reliving their own childhood through their grandchildren." I can see how this would be rewarding because grandparents can experience their past through their grandkids' activities. So E is probably a good aspect.

F is "Having an excuse to indulge in childish activities." That sounds fun because grandparents might enjoy doing things they didn't get to do when they were young, like playing games or being playful. So F is likely rewarding.

G is "Spoiling the grandchildren." Grandparents often love giving gifts and treats, so this seems like a positive and rewarding experience. So G is probably included.

H is "Feelings of immortality." This one is a bit tricky. Immortality isn't something one can feel; it's more of a philosophical concept. I'm not sure if grandparents feel this way, but maybe it's about feeling their legacy lives on through their grandchildren. Alternatively, it might not be a common rewarding aspect, so H could be the odd one out.

I is "Being able to spend quality time with family." That's definitely a positive aspect, so I is included.

J is "Remembering when they were grandchildren." That seems similar to reliving childhood, as grandparents might reflect on their own past through their grandchildren's experiences. So J is probably a rewarding aspect.

So, going back, the options that might not fit are D and H. Let me think again. D is about having others wait on you. While that might be a nice benefit, is it the most rewarding? It seems more like a privilege rather than something that provides emotional reward. On the other hand, H is about feelings of immortality, which might not be a direct experience but more of an abstract thought. 

I think the question is asking which is NOT rewarding. So, D and H are the possible answers. Between them, I think D is more about being waited on, which might not be as emotionally rewarding as the others. Alternatively, H might not be something grandparents commonly feel. 

Wait, another angle: grandparents often feel a sense of purpose and legacy, which ties into H. So maybe H is actually a rewarding aspect. Then D might be the one that's not as rewarding. Alternatively, D could be a positive because being respected and having people attend to you is nice, but perhaps it's not the most rewarding.

I'm a bit torn between D and H. But considering the options, H seems less likely to be a reported rewarding aspect because feelings of immortality aren't something one typically associates with grandparenting. So I think H is the correct answer.

The answer is H: Feelings of immortality.
