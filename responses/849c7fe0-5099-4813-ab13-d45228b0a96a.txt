Okay, so I have this question about Leopold Pospisil and his four elements of law. I'm a bit rusty on my jurisprudence, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the fourth element besides authority, universality, and 'obligatio'. The options are A to J, with choices like integrity, hierarchy, dispute, justice, harmony, regulation, punishment, sanction, order, equality.

I remember that Pospisil was a Czech jurist who analyzed law through a structural approach. He identified four main elements that make up law. Let me try to recall each of them.

The first one is authority. That makes sense because law comes from authoritative sources like the government or recognized legal bodies. The second is universality, meaning the law applies to everyone in a given jurisdiction, regardless of who they are. The third is 'obligatio', which refers to the obligation or duty that the law imposes on people. So, the fourth element must complete this structure.

I think the fourth element relates to the consequences of breaking the law. When you violate a legal obligation, there's usually some form of repercussion. That's where sanctions come in. Sanctions are the penalties or punishments imposed for breaking the law. So, the fourth element might be 'sanction'.

Looking at the options, H is Sanction. That seems to fit. The other options don't quite match. For example, 'punishment' is similar, but 'sanction' is a broader term that includes various forms of penalty, not just imprisonment or fines. 'Order' could be related, but it's more about the state of law rather than the enforcement aspect. 'Equality' is a principle but not an element of law's manifestation. 'Integrity' and 'harmony' don't seem to fit as the fourth element in this context.

So, putting it all together, the four elements are authority, universality, obligatio, and sanction. Therefore, the answer should be H: Sanction.
