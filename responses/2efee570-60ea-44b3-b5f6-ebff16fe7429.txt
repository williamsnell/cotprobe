Okay, so I've got this question about polarization, and I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

First, what do I remember about polarization? I know that polarization refers to the orientation of the oscillations in a wave relative to its direction of travel. So when a wave is polarized, the wave oscillates in a specific direction, like up and down or side to side.

Now, considering the options given:

A: mechanical waves. Well, mechanical waves include things like sound waves and water waves. I think mechanical waves can be polarized, but wait, sound is a longitudinal wave. Longitudinal waves oscillate in the same direction as their propagation. So does that mean they can't be polarized? Because polarization involves oscillations perpendicular to the direction of the wave. If the oscillations are in the same direction as the wave, maybe that's not polarization. Hmm, so maybe mechanical waves like sound can't be polarized. I'm a bit confused here. Wait, no, mechanical waves can be polarized, but maybe only certain types. For example, light is an electromagnetic wave and is transverse, so it's easily polarized. But sound is a longitudinal mechanical wave, so I don't think it's polarized in the same way.

B: sound waves. As I thought earlier, sound is a longitudinal wave. So maybe sound waves aren't polarized. So option B might not be correct.

C: all waves. Well, not all waves are polarized. For example, longitudinal waves like sound don't have polarization because their oscillations are along the direction of the wave. So C might not be correct.

D: None of these. Hmm, but I think some waves are polarized, so D might not be the answer.

E: radio waves. Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic wave, which are transverse. So they can be polarized. But the question is asking what polarization is a property of, not just electromagnetic waves. So E is a correct example, but the answer might be broader.

F: longitudinal waves. No, because longitudinal waves can't be polarized. Their oscillations are in the same direction as propagation, so F is incorrect.

G: gravitational waves. I remember that gravitational waves are transverse waves, and they can be polarized. So G is correct, but again, the question is about which category polarization belongs to.

H: transverse waves. Transverse waves have oscillations perpendicular to their direction of travel, so they can be polarized. So H seems correct.

Wait, the question is asking what polarization is a property of. So the correct answer would be H: transverse waves because only transverse waves can be polarized. But wait, the options are about which category polarization belongs to. So the answer should be H, but let me think again.

Alternatively, some sources say that polarization is a property of transverse waves. So the correct answer would be H. But looking back at the options, the question is phrased as "Polarization is a property of," so it's asking which category of waves exhibit polarization.

Alternatively, if the question is whether all waves have polarization, the answer would be D because only transverse waves can be polarized, and not all waves are transverse. So the correct answer would be H, because polarization is a property of transverse waves.

Wait, but option C says all waves. Since not all waves are polarized, C is incorrect. So the correct answer is H: transverse waves.

Polarization refers to the orientation of oscillations in a wave relative to its direction of travel. It is a property of transverse waves, where the oscillations are perpendicular to the wave's direction. While some mechanical waves, such as light (an electromagnetic wave), can be polarized, sound waves (longitudinal mechanical waves) cannot because their oscillations are parallel to the wave's direction. Gravitational waves, being transverse, can also be polarized. Therefore, polarization is specifically a property of transverse waves.

H: transverse waves
