Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about where people believed in the goddess known as the Holy Mother of Mount Fairy Peach. The options are China, Silla, Goguryeo, and Joseon. I'm a bit rusty on my Asian history, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that the Holy Mother of Mount Fairy Peach is a figure from Chinese folklore. She's associated with Mount Fuji, right? Wait, no, Mount Fuji is actually in Japan. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Or perhaps it's another mountain. Alternatively, I think she's sometimes referred to as the Goddess of Mount Emei, which is in China. That makes sense because I've heard of Emei Shan being a sacred mountain in China with various legends and temples.

Looking at the options: A is China, which seems likely. B is Silla, which was an ancient Korean kingdom, so probably not. C is Goguryeo, another ancient Korean kingdom, also not related to this Chinese goddess. D is Joseon, which is the name of the last dynasty of Korea, so again, probably not the place for this Chinese deity.

Wait, but I also recall that some Korean regions have their own folklore, but this specific goddess I'm pretty sure is Chinese. So the answer should be A: China.
