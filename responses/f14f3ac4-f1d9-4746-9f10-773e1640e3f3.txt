Okay, so I have this question about vertical integration forwards. Hmm, I remember from my studies that vertical integration has to do with a company expanding into different stages of its supply chain. But wait, what's the difference between vertical integration forwards and backwards? Let me think.

Vertical integration is when a company takes over a part of its supply chain either upstream or downstream. Upstream would be towards the suppliers, like getting raw materials, and downstream would be towards the customers, like distribution or retail. So vertical integration forwards must be the downstream part, right?

The question is asking what kind of firm merger or acquisition happens in vertical integration forwards. The options are A to I. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Towards the consumer. That sounds like downstream, which would make sense for vertical forwards. But I'm not sure if it's exactly the right term. 

Option B: With a competitor. That doesn't sound right because vertical integration is about the supply chain, not necessarily competitors unless it's a competitive move, but I think the main point is the supply chain stages.

Option C: At the same stage of the supply chain. No, that would be horizontal integration, where competitors in the same stage merge, not vertical.

Option D: In a different country. That's more about global expansion, not necessarily vertical integration.

Option E: Towards the manufacturer. Hmm, manufacturers are part of the supply chain, but I'm not sure if that's the direction for vertical forwards.

Option F: Towards the source of supply. That sounds like upstream integration, which would be vertical integration backwards, not forwards.

Option G: In another industry. That might be diversification rather than vertical integration.

Option H: At a different stage of the supply chain. This could be either upstream or downstream, so it's a bit general. But vertical integration forwards specifically refers to downstream.

Option I: Towards the supplier of raw materials. That's definitely upstream, so not forwards.

So, vertical integration forwards is when a company moves downstream towards the consumer. So looking at the options, A says "Towards the consumer," which seems correct. But wait, the term "towards" might not be the most precise. Alternatively, option H is about different stages, which could include downstream. But H is more general, while A is more specific to the direction.

Wait, in my notes, vertical integration forwards involves acquiring a company that is later in the supply chain, like a retailer. So the correct direction is towards the consumer. Therefore, the answer should be A.

The correct answer is A: Towards the consumer.
