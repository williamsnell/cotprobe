Question:

One approach to handling fuzzy logic data might be to design a computer using ternary (base-3) logic so that data could be stored as “true,” “false,” and “unknown.” If each ternary logic element is called a flit, how many flits are required to represent at least 256 different values?

Options:

A: 9
B: 4
C: 2
D: 11
E: 10
F: 5
G: 3
H: 6
I: 8
J: 7

Okay, so I have this question about fuzzy logic and ternary systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that each ternary logic element is called a flit, and we need to find out how many flits are required to represent at least 256 different values. The options are from A to J, with numbers like 4, 5, 7, etc.

First, I remember that in computing, when you're dealing with different values, it's about the number of possible states each element can have. So a binary system (base-2) uses 0 and 1, each bit representing a power of 2. But here, it's ternary, which is base-3. So each flit can be 0, 1, or 2, right?

So each flit has 3 possible states. If we have multiple flits, the total number of different values they can represent is 3 raised to the power of the number of flits. The formula would be 3^n, where n is the number of flits.

The problem asks for at least 256 different values. So I need to find the smallest n such that 3^n is greater than or equal to 256.

Let me calculate 3 to various powers:

- 3^1 = 3 → too small.
- 3^2 = 9 → still way below 256.
- 3^3 = 27 → nope.
- 3^4 = 81 → getting closer but still under 256.
- 3^5 = 243 → almost there but 243 is less than 256.
- 3^6 = 729 → now that's way more than 256.

So 5 flits give us 243 possibilities, which is just under 256. So 5 isn't enough. We need to go up to 6 flits to get 729, which is more than enough.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options given are A:9, B:4, C:2, D:11, E:10, F:5, G:3, H:6, I:8, J:7.

So the correct number is 6, which is option H. But wait, the question says "at least 256 different values". So 5 gives 243, which is less. Therefore, the next number is 6.

But wait, another way to think about it: maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to each flit as a ternary digit, so each flit is a trit. So each trit has 3 options. So the number of possible combinations with n trits is 3^n.

So, to get >=256, 3^5=243 <256, so 5 trits isn't enough. 3^6=729 >=256. So 6 trits are needed. So the answer should be 6, which is option H.

Wait, but looking at the options, H is 6. So yes, that's the correct choice.

To determine how many ternary (base-3) logic elements (flits) are required to represent at least 256 different values, we calculate the number of possible combinations as \(3^n\), where \(n\) is the number of flits. 

- \(3^5 = 243\) is less than 256.
- \(3^6 = 729\) is greater than 256.

Thus, 6 flits are needed to represent at least 256 values. 

Answer: H
