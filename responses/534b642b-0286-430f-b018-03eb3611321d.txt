Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to thermodynamics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

A chemist expands an ideal gas against a constant external pressure of 700 mmHg, and the volume changes from 50 to 150 liters. He finds that 1.55 Kcal of heat have been absorbed in the process. I need to determine the internal energy change that took place. The conversion given is 24.217 cal = 1 liter-atm. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, so this involves the first law of thermodynamics, which I remember is ΔU = q + w. Wait, no, wait—wait, different conventions. Sometimes it's ΔU = q - PΔV, but I think I need to get the signs right.

Wait, the formula I remember is the change in internal energy ΔU equals the heat added to the system q minus the work done by the system w. So ΔU = q - w. But wait, sometimes work done by the system is considered positive, so maybe the formula is ΔU = q + (-w), where w is positive when work is done by the system.

Wait, no, let me clarify. When the system does work on the surroundings, like expanding, the work is considered positive in the equation ΔU = q - w. So in this case, the gas is expanding, so it's doing work on the surroundings, meaning w is positive.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the sign conventions. Let me think again. The first law is ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. So if the system does work (like expanding against external pressure), then w is negative because work is leaving the system. So, in that case, ΔU = q - w, with w being positive when work is done on the system.

Alternatively, some sources define work as positive when done by the system, which would make the equation ΔU = q - w. So I need to be careful about the signs.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this methodically. The problem says the gas expands, so the system (the gas) is doing work on the surroundings. So the work done by the system is positive, making the work term negative in the internal energy equation because work done by the system is considered negative in ΔU.

But I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to structure this.

First, the process is an expansion, so the gas does work. The heat absorbed is positive because the system is taking in heat.

The equation I'll use is ΔU = q - w, where w is the work done by the system.

Wait, no, wait another thought: the first law is ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. So when the system does work (expands), w is negative. So in this case, since the gas is expanding, w is negative, so ΔU = q + (-w) = q - w.

But I'm getting myself confused. Let me think of it in terms of work done by the system. The work done by the system is positive, so when calculating ΔU, it's ΔU = q - (work done by system).

Alternatively, some textbooks define the work done by the system as positive, so the equation becomes ΔU = q - w.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the work done and then apply the formula correctly.

So, the work done by the system during expansion is given by w = P_ext * ΔV. But wait, pressure needs to be in the correct units, and the volume in the correct units too.

Wait, the external pressure is given as 700 mmHg. I know that 1 atm is 760 mmHg, so I can convert that to atm to make the units compatible with the given conversion factor of 1 liter-atm = 24.217 cal.

So, let's compute the work done by the gas.

First, the change in volume, ΔV, is 150 L - 50 L = 100 L.

The external pressure is 700 mmHg. Convert that to atm: 700 / 760 atm. Let me calculate that. 700 divided by 760 is approximately 0.9211 atm.

So, the work done by the system (w) is P_ext * ΔV. But wait, since work done by the system is considered positive, so w = P_ext * ΔV.

But wait, wait: work done by the system is positive, so in the equation ΔU = q - w, w is positive. So, let's compute that.

w = 0.9211 atm * 100 L = 92.11 liter-atm.

Now, convert that to calories using the given conversion factor: 24.217 cal = 1 liter-atm.

So, 92.11 * 24.217 cal.

Wait, let me compute that. Let's approximate for now: 90 liter-atm would be 90 *24.217 = 2179.53 cal. 2.11 liter-atm would be about 2.11 *24.217 ≈ 51.13 cal. So total ≈ 2179.53 +51.13= 2230.66 cal. Wait, but that's a lot. Maybe I should do it more accurately.

Wait, 0.9211 atm * 100 L = 92.11 liter-atm.

So, 92.11 * 24.217 cal/liter-atm.

Let me compute 92 *24.217: 90*24.217=2179.53, 2*24.217=48.434 → 2179.53 +48.434=2227.964. Then, 0.11 *24.217=2.66387. So total is approximately 2227.964 + 2.66387 ≈ 2230.628 cal. So about 2230.63 cal.

Wait, but that's a very large number. The heat absorbed is given as 1.55 Kcal, which is 1550 cal. Wait, but the work done is about 2230 cal. That would result in a negative ΔU because work is done by the system, and the heat is positive.

Wait, but 1.55 Kcal is 1550 cal. So, the heat absorbed is 1550 cal, and the work done by the system is approximately 2230 cal.

So, ΔU = q - w → 1550 - 2230.63 ≈ -680.63 cal. Wait, that's about -680.63 cal, which is -680.63 / 1000 = -0.68063 Kcal. Looking at the options, option I is -0.68 Kcal. But wait, let me check if I did the calculations correctly.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the work. Let me recheck.

Wait, the pressure is 700 mmHg, which is 700/760 atm.

700 divided by 760: 700 ÷ 760 = 0.92105263 atm.

So P_ext is approximately 0.92105263 atm.

ΔV is 100 liters.

So, w = P_ext * ΔV = 0.92105263 atm * 100 L = 92.105263 liter-atm.

Now, converting to calories: 92.105263 liter-atm *24.217 cal/(liter-atm) = ?

Let's compute this more accurately.

92.105263 *24.217.

I can compute 92 *24.217:

92 *24 = 2208

92 *0.217 = 19.964

So 92 *24.217=2208 +19.964=2227.964.

Then, 0.105263 *24.217 = ?

0.1 *24.217=2.4217

0.005263 *24.217 ≈ 0.1275.

So total ≈ 2.4217 + 0.1275=2.5492.

So total w in calories is 2227.964 +2.5492=2230.5132 cal.

So w ≈2230.5132 cal.

But wait, the heat absorbed is 1.55 Kcal, which is 1550 cal.

So, ΔU = q - w = 1550 - 2230.5132 ≈ -680.5132 cal, which is approximately -680.5132 cal.

Convert that to Kcal: -680.5132 cal ÷ 1000 = -0.6805132 Kcal.

So, approximately -0.68 Kcal, which matches option I: -0.68 Kcal.

Wait, but wait a second. The expansion work is positive when the system does work, so in the equation ΔU = q - w, where w is work done by the system.

Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. So if the system does work, w is negative.

Let me confirm the formula: ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. So in this case, since the gas expands, the system does work on the surroundings, so w is negative.

So, w = - P_ext * ΔV.

So, in that case, ΔU = q + (-w) = q - w.

Wait, but when I calculated w as P_ext * ΔV, that's the work done by the system, so in the formula, it's ΔU = q - w.

So, the calculation I did earlier is correct.

So, the internal energy change is approximately -0.68 Kcal, which is option I.

But wait, looking at the options, option I is listed as "- .68 Kcal", which I think is the same as -0.68.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because the numbers seem a bit high. Did I make a mistake in the conversion?

Wait, 1 liter-atm is 24.217 cal. So 100 liters at 0.921 atm is 92.105 liter-atm. 92.105 *24.217 is indeed about 2230.5 cal. So 2230.5 cal is the work done by the system.

So, q is 1550 cal, so ΔU is 1550 - 2230.5 = -680.5 cal, which is -0.6805 Kcal, so approximately -0.68 Kcal, which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider if the work was done by the system or on the system. Let me think again.

In thermodynamics, when the system does work on the surroundings, the work is considered positive in the equation where work is the work done by the system. So in ΔU = q - w, w is the work done by the system.

So, that part seems correct.

Therefore, the internal energy change is approximately -0.68 Kcal, which is option I.

To determine the internal energy change (ΔU) for the expansion of the ideal gas, we use the first law of thermodynamics:

\[
\Delta U = q - w
\]

where:
- \( q \) is the heat absorbed by the system,
- \( w \) is the work done by the system.

### Step 1: Calculate the work done by the system
The gas expands against a constant external pressure of 700 mmHg. First, convert this pressure to atm:

\[
P_{\text{ext}} = \frac{700}{760} \, \text{atm} \approx 0.9211 \, \text{atm}.
\]

The change in volume (\( \Delta V \)) is:

\[
\Delta V = 150 \, \text{L} - 50 \, \text{L} = 100 \, \text{L}.
\]

The work done by the system (\( w \)) is given by:

\[
w = P_{\text{ext}} \cdot \Delta V.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
w = 0.9211 \, \text{atm} \cdot 100 \, \text{L} = 92.11 \, \text{liter-atm}.
\]

Convert \( w \) to calories using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{liter-atm} = 24.217 \, \text{cal} \):

\[
w = 92.11 \cdot 24.217 \, \text{cal} \approx 2230.5 \, \text{cal}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the internal energy change
The heat absorbed (\( q \)) is given as \( 1.55 \, \text{Kcal} \), which is equivalent to \( 1550 \, \text{cal} \). Using the formula:

\[
\Delta U = q - w,
\]

substitute the values:

\[
\Delta U = 1550 \, \text{cal} - 2230.5 \, \text{cal} = -680.5 \, \text{cal}.
\]

Convert \( \Delta U \) to kilocalories:

\[
\Delta U = \frac{-680.5 \, \text{cal}}{1000} \approx -0.68 \, \text{Kcal}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The internal energy change is approximately \(-0.68 \, \text{Kcal}\), which corresponds to option **I**.
