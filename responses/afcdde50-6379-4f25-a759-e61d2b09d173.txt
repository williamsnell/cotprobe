Question:

Define a hormone. How would you go about proving that a particular gland is responsible for a specific function?

Options:

A: A hormone is a type of organ
B: A hormone is a type of tissue
C: A hormone is an electrical signal sent through the nervous system to communicate between different parts of the body.
D: A hormone is a mineral that is involved in maintaining the balance of water in the body.
E: A hormone is a chemical substance synthesized by a specific organ or tissue and secreted directly into the blood.
F: A hormone is a structural protein that makes up the components of muscles and tissues.
G: A hormone is a digestive enzyme that breaks down food in the stomach and intestines.
H: A hormone is a type of vitamin that the body needs in small amounts to function properly.
I: A hormone is a type of cell
J: A hormone is a biological molecule that remains within the organ it is produced in and affects only that specific organ.

Okay, I need to answer this multiple-choice question about hormones and how to prove a gland's responsibility for a specific function. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question has two parts. The first part asks to define a hormone. The options are from A to J. I remember that hormones are chemicals produced by glands in the endocrine system. They travel through the bloodstream to target cells and regulate various bodily functions. So looking at the options:

Option A says a hormone is a type of organ. That doesn't make sense because hormones are chemicals, not organs themselves. So A is wrong.

Option B says a hormone is a type of tissue. No, tissues are groups of similar cells, not the hormones. So B is incorrect.

Option C says a hormone is an electrical signal through the nervous system. Wait, electrical signals are more like nerve impulses or neurotransmitters, not hormones. Hormones are part of the endocrine system, which is separate from the nervous system. So C is wrong.

Option D says it's a mineral involved in water balance. I know that water balance is regulated by hormones like ADH, but a hormone isn't just a mineral. So D isn't correct.

Option E describes a hormone as a chemical substance made by a specific organ or tissue and secreted into the blood. That sounds right. I remember that hormones are produced by glands, like the thyroid, and released into the bloodstream to affect other parts of the body. So E seems correct.

Option F says it's a structural protein. No, proteins can be structural, but hormones are usually small molecules or peptides. So F is wrong.

Option G refers to a digestive enzyme. No, digestive enzymes are like amylase or lipase, not hormones. So G is incorrect.

Option H says it's a vitamin. Vitamins are nutrients needed in small amounts, but they aren't hormones. So H is wrong.

Option I claims a hormone is a type of cell. No, cells produce hormones, but the hormones themselves aren't cells. So I is incorrect.

Option J says a hormone is a molecule that stays in the organ and affects only that organ. That doesn't sound right because hormones usually travel through the bloodstream and affect distant cells. So J is wrong.

So for the first part, the correct definition is E.

Now the second part of the question: How would you prove a particular gland is responsible for a specific function? I think this refers to the process of identifying the source of a hormone. One method is to use radioactive tracing. You could inject a radioactive substance into the gland, then track where it appears in the body. If the substance shows up in areas where the function is active, that suggests the gland is responsible.

Alternatively, another method might involve removing the gland and observing if the function ceases. For example, if you remove the thyroid gland and the patient develops hypothyroidism, that indicates the thyroid is responsible for thyroid hormone production.

Looking back at the options, the second part isn't listed, but the question is part of the same multiple-choice. Wait, no, the options are all about the definition, not the method. So the second part is part of the question but not part of the options. The user is asking to select the correct definition. Since the correct definition is E, that's the answer.

The correct answer is E. A hormone is a chemical substance synthesized by a specific organ or tissue and secreted directly into the blood. 

Answer: E
