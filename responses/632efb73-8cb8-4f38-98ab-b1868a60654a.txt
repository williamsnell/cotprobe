2. It would be impossible for services to get a TCP connection to a database proxy.

Options:

A: False, True
B: False, False
C: True, True
D: True, False

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the OKWS design and how it would be affected if Unix didn't provide a way to pass file descriptors between processes, but still allowed inheriting them on fork and exec. The question is asking which aspects would break under these circumstances.

First, I need to understand the scenario. Normally, Unix allows passing file descriptors between processes, which is important for certain inter-process communication. But in this case, that feature is missing. However, when a process forks or executes a new program, it can still inherit file descriptors from its parent.

The question has two parts: whether it's impossible for services to send messages to oklogd, and whether it's impossible to get a TCP connection to a database proxy.

I remember that in systems like OKWS, services often communicate with each other using shared libraries or other IPC mechanisms. Oklogd is a service that logs messages, so services probably send messages to it. If file descriptors can't be passed, how would they communicate?

If file descriptors can't be passed, but are inherited, maybe the parent process can open a socket or a pipe and then the child processes can use those inherited descriptors. But wait, the question says that file descriptor passing isn't available, but inheritance is allowed on fork and exec.

So for the first part, sending messages to oklogd. If the service needs to send messages, perhaps it's using a socket. If the parent process (maybe a server) has a socket connected to oklogd, then when a child process is created (like a service), it can inherit that socket's file descriptor. So the service could still send messages using that inherited FD, even without passing it explicitly. So the first part wouldn't be impossible, meaning the statement is false.

Now the second part: getting a TCP connection to a database proxy. A TCP connection typically uses a socket. If a service wants to connect to the database proxy, it would need to create a socket, bind, and connect. If the service can't pass file descriptors but can inherit them, maybe the parent process can create the socket and the child can inherit it. Alternatively, the child can create its own socket because it can still create new file descriptors. Wait, but without the ability to pass existing ones, can the child create a new socket and connect?

Wait, the issue is about passing, not creating. So the child can create a new socket (since that's a new FD), but if the parent has an existing socket connected to the database proxy, the child can't get that FD unless it's passed or inherited. If the parent doesn't pass it, the child can't use it. So if the service needs to connect to the database proxy, perhaps it's using a shared socket that the parent had. Without being able to pass it, the child can't get that FD, so it can't connect. Alternatively, maybe the child can create its own socket and connect, but that depends on whether the database proxy is expecting connections from the service directly or through a shared FD.

Wait, but in the case where the parent process (like a server) has already established a connection to the database proxy, and the child service needs to use that same connection. Without being able to pass the FD, the child can't access that connection, so it would be impossible. But if the child can create its own connection, then it's possible.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about what would break. If file descriptors can't be passed, but can be inherited, then any process that is a child of the parent can inherit the FDs the parent has opened. So if the parent has a socket connected to the database proxy, the child can inherit that FD and use it. So the child wouldn't need to pass it; it would already have it. So the second part wouldn't be impossible either. Wait, but the question is whether it's impossible. So in that case, both statements would be false, meaning the answer would be B: False, False.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question is about the design breaking. So if services can't pass FDs, but can inherit them, would the design still work?

For the first part, sending messages to oklogd: if the service is a child of the parent that has the FD to oklogd's socket, then it can inherit it and send messages. So the first statement (impossible) is false.

For the second part, getting a TCP connection: if the service can create its own socket and connect to the proxy, then it's possible. But if the proxy requires an FD that the parent had, which wasn't passed, then it's impossible. But the question is about the design aspects that would break. So if the database proxy is something that expects the service to inherit a connection from the parent, then without passing FDs, the child can't get that connection. But if the service can create its own connection, then it's possible.

Wait, but in OKWS, services are usually separate processes. So perhaps the database proxy is another service that the service needs to connect to. If the service can't pass FDs, but can create new ones, it can still connect via TCP. So the second statement would be false.

Wait, but the question is whether it's impossible. So in the first case, the service can send messages if it inherits the FD, so it's possible, making the first statement false. In the second case, the service can create its own TCP connection, so it's possible, making the second statement false. Therefore, both statements are false, so the answer would be B: False, False.

Alternatively, maybe the database connection is handled via a shared socket that the parent has, which the child can't get without passing FDs. So the child can't connect, making the second statement true. But I'm not entirely sure.

I think the key is that without passing FDs, but with inheritance, the child can still get the FDs the parent has. So if the parent has a socket connected to the database proxy, the child can use it. But if the parent doesn't have it, the child has to create its own. So if the design relies on the parent passing the FD, then without that, it's impossible. But if the design allows the child to create its own, it's possible.

Hmm, this is tricky. I'm leaning towards both being possible, so the answer is B: False, False.

The scenario considers the impact of removing file descriptor passing in Unix but allowing inheritance during fork and exec on the OKWS design. Without file descriptor passing, processes can still inherit file descriptors from their parent. 

For the first aspect, services can send messages to `oklogd` if they inherit the relevant file descriptor from the parent process, which already has the connection. Thus, it is possible, making the statement false.

For the second aspect, services can establish a TCP connection to a database proxy by either inheriting an existing socket from the parent or creating a new socket. Since file descriptor creation is still possible, the service can connect, making the statement false.

Therefore, both aspects would not break, leading to the answer:

Answer: B
