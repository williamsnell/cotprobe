Okay, so I've got this accounting question here about consolidated financial statements. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question says King, Inc. owns 70% of Simmon Co’s outstanding common stock. That means King is the parent company, and Simmon is the subsidiary. So when consolidating, we'll combine their financials, but eliminate any intercompany transactions or holdings.

King's liabilities are $450,000, and Simmon's are $200,000. But Simmon has a $100,000 note payable to King. Wait, that's an intercompany loan, right? So in the consolidated statements, we should eliminate that because it's essentially King lending to itself through the subsidiary.

So, normally, you'd just add up the liabilities: 450k + 200k = 650k. But since there's a $100k note from Simmon to King, that's an internal transaction. That means in the consolidated balance sheet, that liability should be eliminated because it's a debt the subsidiary owes to the parent, which is part of the same entity when consolidated.

So subtracting that $100k from the total. So 650k minus 100k is 550k. Wait, but let me think again. Are there any other considerations? Like, does the note affect the equity or anything else?

Wait, King owns 70% of Simmon, so Simmon's equity would be part of the consolidated equity, but for liabilities, we're only looking at the total of both companies minus the intercompany liability.

So yes, the total liabilities would be 450k (King's) + 200k (Simmon's) = 650k. Then subtract the 100k intercompany note, so 550k.

Looking at the options, G is 550k, so that should be the answer.

The correct answer is G: $550,000. In consolidated financial statements, intercompany liabilities like the $100,000 note payable from Simmon to King are eliminated. Adding King's and Simmon's liabilities and subtracting the intercompany note gives $550,000.

Answer: G
