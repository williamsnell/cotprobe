Question:

Standing waves are produced by a 100-Hz generator in a string of fixed length. The tension in the string is increased until a new set of standing waves is produced. Will the wavelength of the new standing waves be greater than or less than the wavelength of the original standing waves?

Options:

A: The wavelength will be greater, because the tension in the string varies inversely with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.
B: Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.
C: The wavelength cannot be determined without more information about the properties of the string and the wave generator.
D: Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.
E: Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.
F: Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.
G: The wavelength will be less, because the tension in the string varies inversely with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.
H: The wavelength will be greater, because the increased tension in the string will cause an increase in the wave speed, resulting in a longer wavelength.
I: The wavelength will remain the same, because the tension in the string does not affect the wavelength.
J: The wavelength will be less, because the increased tension in the string will cause a decrease in the wave speed, resulting in a shorter wavelength.

Alright, so I've got this physics problem about standing waves and how changing the tension affects the wavelength. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Okay, the problem says that a 100-Hz generator produces standing waves in a string of fixed length. Then, the tension is increased, leading to a new set of standing waves. The question is whether the new wavelength is greater than or less than the original one.

First, I remember that the frequency of a wave is given by f = v/λ, where v is the wave speed and λ is the wavelength. Since the generator frequency is the same (100 Hz), the frequency doesn't change. But the wave speed v is affected by the tension in the string.

Wait, what's the relationship between tension and wave speed? Oh right, the wave speed on a string depends on the tension and the linear mass density. The formula is v = sqrt(T/μ), where T is tension and μ is linear mass density. So, if tension increases, wave speed increases because T is in the numerator under the square root.

So, the wave speed v increases when tension is increased. Now, since the frequency f is fixed at 100 Hz, and f = v/λ, rearranging gives λ = v/f. If v increases while f stays the same, then λ must increase as well. So the wavelength should get longer when tension increases.

Let me double-check that. If the wave speed goes up, and the frequency is the same, the wavelength must go up because λ is proportional to v. For example, if v doubles, λ doubles too, keeping f the same.

But wait, in standing waves, the length of the string is fixed. So the possible wavelengths are determined by the harmonics. The fundamental wavelength is 2L, then 2L/2, 2L/3, etc. So when the tension changes, the wave speed changes, which affects the possible harmonics. But the frequency of the generator might still be the same, so it might produce a higher harmonic if the speed increases.

Wait, but the problem states that a new set of standing waves is produced. So maybe the generator is still driving at 100 Hz, but the new standing wave corresponds to a different harmonic. Let me think. Suppose initially, the string was vibrating in its fundamental mode (n=1), so λ = 2L. If the tension increases, v increases, so for the same frequency (100 Hz), the wavelength λ = v/f would be longer. But wait, the string length is fixed, so the possible wavelengths are 2L, L, 2L/3, etc. So if tension increases, v increases, so to have f = 100 Hz, λ = v/f. Since v increases, λ increases. But the string's length must support that wavelength as a standing wave.

Hmm, so if the original wavelength was λ1, and then the new wavelength is λ2, which is longer than λ1. But the string's length L must satisfy nλ = 2L for some integer n. So if the wavelength increases, the number of nodes (harmonic number) might decrease. For example, if the new λ is longer, it could correspond to a lower harmonic number, like going from n=3 to n=2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it differently. The key point is that when tension increases, wave speed increases. Since the frequency (from the generator) remains the same, the wavelength must also increase because λ = v/f.

So, the options say whether the new wavelength is greater or less than the original. From my reasoning, it's greater. Let's look at the options.

Option H says greater because increased tension increases wave speed, leading to longer wavelength. That makes sense. Option D says greater because tension varies directly with wave speed, which varies inversely with wavelength. Wait, no—wave speed increases with tension, so v ∝ sqrt(T). Since λ = v/f, and f is same, λ increases as v increases. So option H seems correct.

Other options: Option A says greater because tension varies inversely with wave speed. Wait, no, tension and wave speed are directly related. So A is incorrect. Option D says tension varies directly with wave speed, which is correct, but then says v varies inversely with λ. Wait, if v increases, and λ = v/f, then λ increases. So D's reasoning might be confusing. Let me look at the options again.

Option H: Greater, because increased tension increases wave speed, leading to longer wavelength. That seems correct.

Option E: Less, because tension varies directly with wave speed, which varies inversely with wavelength. Wait, if v increases (tension increases), and since λ = v/f, λ increases. So E says less, which contradicts. So E is wrong.

Option J says less because increased tension decreases wave speed. No, because v increases with tension. So J is wrong.

Hmm, so the correct reasoning leads to the wavelength being greater. So the answer is H.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The string length is fixed, so when the tension changes, the fundamental frequency changes. The generator's frequency is fixed at 100 Hz, so it might cause a standing wave at a different harmonic. Let's think about the fundamental frequency f1 = v/(2L), where v is wave speed. So if v increases, f1 increases. But the generator is at 100 Hz, so if 100 Hz is higher than the new f1, then the standing wave would be a higher harmonic. Or maybe lower.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of what happens when tension increases. Suppose initially, the string was vibrating in its nth harmonic. When tension increases, v increases, so the fundamental frequency f1 increases. But the generator is fixed at 100 Hz, so the string must now support a standing wave at 100 Hz. If f1 increases, then 100 Hz could be a lower harmonic, meaning a longer wavelength. For example, if before, 100 Hz was the fundamental (n=1), and after, f1 becomes higher than 100 Hz, then 100 Hz would correspond to a lower harmonic, like n=0.5? But that's not possible. Wait, maybe the original situation was that 100 Hz was a harmonic, and after tension increases, the same 100 Hz corresponds to a different harmonic, possibly a higher one, but that would mean a shorter wavelength. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the initial and final scenarios. Let's say initially, the frequency is 100 Hz, and the string has a certain tension T1, leading to wave speed v1. The wavelength λ1 = v1 / 100.

After increasing tension, the wave speed becomes v2 > v1, so the new wavelength λ2 = v2 / 100. Since v2 > v1, λ2 > λ1. So the wavelength increases. So the answer should be that the new wavelength is greater than the original.

So the correct option is H.
</think>

When tension in a string increases, the wave speed \( v \) increases because \( v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \), where \( T \) is tension and \( \mu \) is the linear mass density. Since the generator frequency \( f \) remains constant at 100 Hz, the wavelength \( \lambda \) is given by \( \lambda = \frac{v}{f} \). As \( v \) increases, \( \lambda \) also increases. Therefore, the new wavelength will be greater than the original wavelength.

The correct answer is:

**H: The wavelength will be greater, because the increased tension in the string will cause an increase in the wave speed, resulting in a longer wavelength.**
