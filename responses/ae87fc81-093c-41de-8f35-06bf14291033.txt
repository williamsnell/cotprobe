Alright, so I've got this question about the term 'eyeballing' and I'm supposed to figure out which option correctly describes the technique. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that 'eyeballing' is a common term, but I'm not exactly sure of its technical definition. Let me think about where I've heard it used. I remember hearing it in contexts like construction or maybe even casual conversations. From what I recall, it's something to do with estimating or measuring without using tools. Like, using just your eyes to gauge something.

Looking at the options, option A says "estimating measurements by sight without using tools." That sounds familiar. I think that's right because when someone 'eyeballs' something, they're not using a ruler or a measuring tape; they're just visually assessing it.

Option B mentions keeping eyes on research participants, which doesn't ring a bell. That sounds more like monitoring in a study, but I don't think that's what 'eyeballing' refers to.

Option C is about quickly reading a document to get the gist. That's more like skimming, so probably not related to eyeballing.

Option D talks about observing closely to identify details. While observation is part of it, 'eyeballing' is more about estimation rather than detailed observation.

Option E is about inspecting a construction site for safety. That's a specific use case, but I think the term is broader than that. It's not just for construction; it can be used in other contexts as well.

Option F suggests looking at a problem and guessing the solution based on experience. While experience does play a role in estimation, I'm not sure if that's the primary definition of eyeballing.

Option G is about gathering samples from people in public places. That doesn't seem related at all.

Option H is about quickly reading a research paper to identify main arguments. Again, that's more about reading quickly, not about visual estimation.

Option I talks about looking at a situation and identifying risks. That could be part of it, but I think the primary meaning is about measuring or estimating.

Option J is scanning a table for patterns and figures. That seems more like data analysis, not eyeballing.

So, putting it all together, the most accurate option is A: estimating measurements by sight without using tools. I think that's the correct definition because I've heard it used in contexts where people need to quickly assess something without precise tools, relying on their visual judgment.

The term 'eyeballing' refers to the technique of estimating measurements by sight without using tools. This method involves visually assessing something to determine its size, alignment, or other characteristics without the aid of measuring instruments.
