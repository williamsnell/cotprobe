Question:

What is meant by forward and backward shifting?

Options:

A: Forward shifting is a company increasing its product prices, backward shifting is decreasing them
B: Forward shifting is the process of innovation and product development, while backward shifting is the phasing out of obsolete products.
C: Forward shifting is when a government increases regulation on businesses, and backward shifting is when it decreases regulation.
D: Forward shifting involves a company moving towards newer markets, while backward shifting means retreating from existing markets.
E: Forward shifting occurs when a businessman is able to pass the burden of that tax onto its customers in the form of higher prices. Backward shifting occurs when this businessman is able to pass the burden of that tax onto its workers, in the form of lower wages, or onto its suppliers, in the form of lower resource payments.
F: Forward shifting is when a company moves its operations to a more advanced technological stage, backward shifting is reverting to less advanced technology.
G: Forward shifting relates to future business predictions while backward shifting is analyzing past business performance
H: Forward shifting is a business expanding while backward shifting is a business downsizing
I: Forward shifting refers to the transfer of production processes to future dates, and backward shifting refers to moving production to earlier dates.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about forward and backward shifting. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. I remember that shifting in economics or business terms usually has something to do with how costs or benefits are transferred between different parties or over time.

The question is asking what forward and backward shifting mean. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A says forward shifting is increasing prices and backward is decreasing. That sounds a bit like pricing strategies, but I'm not sure if that's the standard definition. I think shifting usually refers to transferring costs, not just changing prices.

Option B talks about innovation and phasing out products. That doesn't ring a bell. Innovation is more about product development, and phasing out is just ending old products. I don't think that's shifting.

Option C mentions government regulation. Forward shifting as increasing regulation and backward as decreasing. I don't recall shifting being about regulation changes. It feels off.

Option D says forward is moving to new markets and backward is retreating. That sounds a bit like market expansion or contraction, but I don't think that's the term for shifting. More like market strategy.

Option E describes forward shifting as passing tax burden to customers via higher prices, and backward as passing it to workers or suppliers through lower wages or payments. This sounds familiar. I remember something about cost shifting where businesses pass costs onto others. Tax shifting makes sense hereâ€”like shifting the tax burden forward to consumers by raising prices, or backward to employees or suppliers by cutting costs.

Option F talks about technological stages. Forward shifting to advanced tech, backward to less. That seems more like technological upgrades or downgrades, not shifting in the economic sense.

Option G relates to future predictions vs past analysis. That doesn't fit the term shifting. More like forecasting and analysis.

Option H is business expansion vs downsizing. Again, that's about company growth or contraction, not shifting.

Option I mentions production processes moved to future or past dates. That sounds like scheduling, perhaps in manufacturing. Like moving production dates forward or backward, but I'm not sure if that's the standard definition of shifting.

Option J is about currency value changes. Forward and backward in currency terms usually refer to future and spot markets, not shifting in the cost or tax sense.

So, putting it together, Option E seems the most accurate. It explains shifting in terms of passing costs (like taxes) either to customers by increasing prices (forward shifting) or to suppliers/employees by lowering payments (backward shifting). That aligns with what I remember about cost shifting in economics.

The correct answer is E. Forward shifting refers to passing the tax burden to customers through higher prices, while backward shifting involves passing it to workers or suppliers by lowering wages or resource payments.

Answer: E
