Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A young scientist is watching a group of new-born ducklings. On the first day, he observes them to crouch in fear at the sight of falling leaves. He also sees them "practice" flying. Over the next few days he observes that they do not react to the falling leaves and can now fly expertly. He concludes that the ducklings have learned to ignore falling leaves and have also learned to fly. Why is he partly incorrect?

Options:

A: The ducklings are 'learning' to not fear falling leaves.
B: The ducklings are genetically programmed to not fear falling leaves after a certain age.
C: The ducklings are demonstrating a natural instinct to fly, which does not require learning.
D: The ducklings are 'learning' to fly through practice.
E: The ducklings are exhibiting a learned behavior to avoid falling leaves, thinking they are predators.
F: The ducklings are 'learning' to fly as a result of imitating other flying birds.
G: The ducklings are using trial and error to master flying, which is a form of learning.
H: The ducklings are not 'learning' to fly, they are maturing. Their ability to fly improves due to the development of their nervous and muscular systems, not because of practice or experience.
I: The ducklings are developing a conditioned response to ignore falling leaves.
J: The ducklings are adapting their behavior based on their environment.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the scientist's conclusion is partly incorrect. Let me read the question again carefully.

The scientist observes new-born ducklings on the first day. They crouch in fear when they see falling leaves and also practice flying. Over the next days, they stop reacting to the falling leaves and can fly well. He thinks they've learned to ignore the leaves and learned to fly.

Wait, why is he wrong? I think it has to do with whether these behaviors are learned or instinctive. Ducklings are young, so maybe some behaviors are instinctual.

First, about the falling leaves: On day one, they fear them, then stop reacting. Maybe that's learned, like they realize leaves aren't dangerous. But wait, some animals are born with instincts. Maybe the fear of falling leaves isn't learned but something they're born with. Or perhaps it's a startle reflex that goes away as they mature.

Then, the flying. He says they practice and later fly expertly, so he thinks they learned. But birds, including ducks, start flying when they're ready, which might be due to physical development rather than learning. Like, their wings and muscles grow, so they can fly better over time, not because they practiced and learned.

So the scientist's mistake is probably thinking that the flying is learned through practice, when in fact it's more about maturation and physical development.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the ducklings are demonstrating a natural instinct to fly, which doesn't require learning. That makes sense because flying might be instinctual, not learned by practice.

Option H says they're maturing, and their ability improves due to nervous and muscular development, not practice. That also seems correct because physical growth, not learning, might be the main factor.

Wait, the question asks why he's partly incorrect. He concluded both behaviors were learned. So for the flying part, if it's due to maturation, then that part of his conclusion is wrong.

So the answer would be H because the ducklings aren't learning to fly through practice; their ability improves as they grow.

Alternatively, C says it's a natural instinct. But perhaps the flying is both instinct and practice, but the main point is that the improvement isn't due to learning but maturation.

Another angle: learning involves experience and practice leading to behavior changes. If the ducklings get better at flying as they grow, that's maturation, not learning.

So the correct answer would be H. The ducklings are maturing, not learning through practice.

The scientist's conclusion is partly incorrect because while the ducklings may have learned to ignore falling leaves, their ability to fly is not due to learning through practice but rather the natural maturation of their nervous and muscular systems. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H

The ducklings are not 'learning' to fly, they are maturing. Their ability to fly improves due to the development of their nervous and muscular systems, not because of practice or experience.

H
