Okay, so I need to figure out how Allport's concept of functional autonomy differs from most other theories of motivation. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that Allport was a psychologist who focused on personality theory. He talked about traits and how they function in a person's behavior. One of his key concepts is functional autonomy, which I think refers to how certain traits become more important over time, almost taking on a life of their own, separate from the person's original motivations.

So, the question is asking how this concept is different from other motivation theories. Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A says functional autonomy permits a relative divorce from the past of the organism. That sounds interesting. I think Allport's idea is that as people grow, their traits can become more autonomous, meaning they aren't strictly tied to past experiences anymore. So maybe this is about moving away from the past influences.

Option B states that functional autonomy maintains current motives are tied to history. That seems opposite to what I remember. Allport's idea is more about traits becoming independent, so B might not be correct.

Option C says behavior is a reaction to immediate stimuli. That sounds more like behaviorism, which is different from Allport's trait theory. So probably not C.

Option D mentions motivation decreasing with age. I don't recall Allport saying that. In fact, functional autonomy suggests traits can become more prominent as one matures, so D might be incorrect.

Option E relies on biological drives. Allport's theory is more about psychological traits than biological drives, so E doesn't seem right.

Option F suggests all behavior is learned associations. That sounds like operant or classical conditioning, not Allport's approach, so F is probably wrong.

Option G is about external rewards and punishments. Again, that's more Skinnerian, not Allport's functional autonomy.

Option H emphasizes past experiences. If functional autonomy is about moving away from the past, then H might be incorrect because it's more about the present traits rather than past influences.

Option I requires constant reinforcement. That doesn't fit with Allport's idea of traits becoming autonomous, so I think I is wrong.

Option J limits it to early childhood. Allport's concept applies across the lifespan, so J is probably incorrect.

Putting it together, Allport's functional autonomy is about how traits become more self-sustaining and less tied to past causes. So, the idea is that as people develop, their traits can operate somewhat independently of their original historical context. That matches option A: a relative divorce from the past.

The correct answer is A: Functional autonomy permits a relative divorce from the past of the organism. Allport's concept suggests that as individuals develop, their traits can become more autonomous, operating independently of their historical context, unlike other theories that may emphasize past influences or immediate stimuli.
