Okay, so I've got this problem to solve about the fugacity of carbon dioxide using the reduced Berthelot equation. Hmm, fugacity... I remember that's a measure of the effective pressure of a real gas. The equation given is z = [(PV)/(RT)] = 1 + [9/(128)] * [(PT_c)/(P_cT)] * [1 - 6{(T_c²)/(T²)}]. 

Alright, let me break this down. The question gives me T_c as 304.3 K and P_c as 73.0 atm. The temperature T is 150°C, which I need to convert to Kelvin. So, adding 273 to 150 gives T = 323 K. The pressure P is 50 atm.

Wait, but wait, the equation has terms like (PT_c)/(P_c T). So I need to plug in all these values into the equation step by step.

First, let me write down all the values:

T_c = 304.3 K
P_c = 73.0 atm
T = 323 K (since 150 + 273 = 323)
P = 50 atm

Now, let's compute each part. The equation is:

z = 1 + [9/128] * [ (P T_c) / (P_c T) ] * [1 - 6*(T_c² / T²)]

Let me compute each bracket step by step.

First, calculate (P T_c)/(P_c T):

P = 50 atm, T_c = 304.3 K, P_c =73.0 atm, T=323 K.

So (50 * 304.3) / (73.0 * 323) = ?

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 50 * 304.3 = 15,215

Denominator: 73 * 323 ≈ 73 * 300 = 21,900 and 73 *23 = 1,679, so total ≈ 23,579.

So (15,215)/(23,579) ≈ approximately 0.646.

Wait, more accurately, let me compute 73 * 323:

73 * 300 = 21,900
73 * 23 = 1,679
Total: 21,900 + 1,679 = 23,579.

So 50*304.3 = 15,215.

15,215 / 23,579 ≈ let me compute this division.

23,579 goes into 15,215 about 0.646 times.

Wait, 23,579 * 0.6 = 14,147.4

23,579 * 0.64 = 14,147.4 + (0.04 *23,579)= 943.16 → total 15,090.56

Now 15,215 - 15,090.56 = 124.44

So next, 124.44 / 23,579 ≈ 0.00527.

So total is approx 0.64 + 0.00527 ≈ 0.6453.

So (PT_c)/(P_c T) ≈ 0.6453.

Next, the term [1 - 6*(T_c² / T²)].

Compute T_c² and T²:

T_c = 304.3 → T_c² = 304.3² ≈ let's compute that.

300² is 90,000. 4.3² is ~18.49. Cross term: 2*300*4.3=2580.

So (304.3)^2 = (300 +4.3)^2 = 300² + 2*300*4.3 +4.3² = 90,000 + 2580 +18.49 ≈ 92,600 (approx).

Wait, more accurately:

304.3 * 304.3: Let me compute 300*300=90,000; 300*4.3=1290; 4.3*300=1290; 4.3*4.3=18.49.

Wait, no, the correct way is (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

So a=300, b=4.3.

a²=90,000.

2ab=2*300*4.3= 2*1290=2580.

b²=18.49.

So sum: 90,000 + 2580 = 92,580 +18.49=92,598.49 ≈ 92,598.5.

T_c² ≈ 92,598.5 K².

T is 323 K, so T²=323².

323^2: 300^2=90,000; 2*300*23=13,800; 23^2=529. So 90,000+13,800=103,800 +529=104,329.

So T²=104,329 K².

Now, (T_c²)/(T²) = 92,598.5 / 104,329 ≈ let's compute that.

Approx 92,598.5 / 104,329 ≈ 0.888.

Wait, 92,598.5 ÷ 104,329. Let me compute 92,598.5 / 104,329.

Well, 104,329 * 0.89 = 92,598.41 (since 104,329 *0.89: 104,329 *0.8=83,463.2; 0.09*104,329≈9,389.61 → total 92,852.81, which is a bit higher than 92,598.5. So perhaps 0.888.

Alternatively, let's compute 92,598.5 ÷ 104,329 ≈ 0.888.

So 0.888.

Then 6*(T_c² / T²) = 6 *0.888 ≈5.328.

So [1 - 5.328] = 1 -5.328 = -4.328.

Wait, that can't be right because that makes the term negative, but looking back, the equation is [1 -6*(T_c² / T²)].

Wait, but wait, that would be 1 -6*(0.888) = 1 -5.328= -4.328.

Wait, that's a negative value. Hmm, but does that make sense? Because if T is higher than the critical temperature, but wait, wait—carbon dioxide's critical temperature is 304.3 K, and the given T is 323 K, which is above T_c. But wait, the Berthelot equation is applicable in the one-fluid region, where T > T_c. So that's okay.

But the term [1 -6*(T_c²/T²)] would be negative if T > T_c, because T_c² < T², so 6*(T_c²/T²) <6, so 1 - something less than 6 would be negative.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me recheck the calculation:

T_c=304.3 K, T=323 K.

T_c²= (304.3)^2 ≈92,598.5.

T²=323^2=104,329.

So T_c²/T²=92598.5/104329≈0.888.

Multiply by 6: 6*0.888≈5.328.

So 1 -5.328= -4.328.

So that's correct.

Now, putting it all together:

z = 1 + [9/128] * [0.6453] * [ -4.328 ]

Compute each step:

First, 9/128 ≈0.0703125.

Then multiply by 0.6453: 0.0703125 * 0.6453 ≈0.04535.

Then multiply by -4.328: 0.04535 * (-4.328) ≈-0.196.

So the entire second term is approximately -0.196.

So z ≈1 + (-0.196) =0.804.

Wait, but wait, that gives z=0.804. So PV/RT=0.804, which is less than 1. That would imply that the fugacity coefficient φ = z, so φ=0.804. Therefore, fugacity f = φ * P = 0.804 *50 atm ≈40.2 atm.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them is exactly 40.2. The options are A:60.5, B:37.8, C:50, D:73, E:88.1, F:25.6, G:46.4, H:304.3, I:55.2.

Wait, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Maybe I messed up the calculation steps.

Let me double-check the calculation:

Compute [9/(128)] * [ (PT_c)/(Pc T) ] * [1 -6 (Tc²/T²)]

We have:

(PT_c)/(Pc T) = (50 *304.3)/(73 *323) ≈ (15,215)/(23,579)≈0.6453.

[1-6*(Tc²/T²)]=1 -6*(92,598.5/104,329) =1 -6*(0.888)=1-5.328= -4.328.

So [9/128] is approximately 0.0703125.

Now, 0.0703125 * 0.6453 = let's compute that more accurately.

0.0703125 * 0.6453:

0.07 *0.6453≈0.04517.

0.0003125 *0.6453≈0.0002016.

Total ≈0.04537.

Then 0.04537 * (-4.328) ≈-0.196.

So z=1 -0.196=0.804.

So z=0.804.

But wait, fugacity is φ=P*z, so f=50 *0.804=40.2 atm.

Wait, but the options don't have 40.2. The closest is option B:37.8, which is lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing (PT_c)/(Pc T). Let me recalculate that.

(50 *304.3) =50 *300=15,000, plus 50*4.3=215 → total 15,215.

Pc*T=73 *323.

Let me compute 73 *323 more accurately.

Compute 70*323=22,610.

3*323=969.

Total=22,610 +969=23,579.

So (50*304.3)/(73*323)=15,215/23,579≈0.6453.

That's correct.

Next, 1-6*(Tc²/T²)=1-6*(92,598.5/104,329)=1-6*(0.888)=1-5.328=-4.328.

That's correct.

Then, [9/128]=0.0703125.

Multiply by 0.6453: 0.0703125 *0.6453≈0.04537.

Multiply by -4.328: 0.04537 * (-4.328)= let's compute:

0.04537 *4=0.1815.

0.04537 *0.328≈0.01486.

So 0.04537 *4.328≈0.1815 +0.01486=0.19636.

So with the negative sign, it's -0.19636.

So z=1 + (-0.19636)=0.80364≈0.804.

So fugacity f= z * P= 0.804 *50=40.2 atm.

Hmm, but none of the options match. The options are:

A:60.5

B:37.8

C:50

D:73.0

E:88.1

F:25.6

G:46.4

H:304.3

I:55.2

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula? Let me check the given equation again.

The equation is z = 1 + [9/128] * [(PT_c)/(Pc T)] * [1 - 6 (Tc²/T²)].

Yes, that's what I used.

Wait, but maybe I should have used the reduced temperature and pressure variables. Oh wait, the Berthelot equation is expressed in terms of reduced variables.

Wait, the reduced temperature Tr = T / Tc, and reduced pressure Pr = P / Pc.

Wait, but in the equation, it's (P Tc)/(Pc T) = (P/Pc) * (Tc/T) )= Pr * (Tc/T) = Pr * (1/Tr).

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as Pr * (Tc/T) = (P/Pc) * (Tc/T).

Wait, but I think I did that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute (P Tc)/(Pc T) as (P/Pc) * (Tc/T) = (50/73) * (304.3/323).

Wait, 50/73≈0.6849.

304.3/323≈0.942.

So 0.6849 *0.942≈0.645, which matches my earlier calculation.

So that's correct.

Hmm, but perhaps I messed up the sign. Let me see: The term [1 -6*(Tc²/T²)] is negative because T is above Tc, so Tc²/T² <1.

But let me think: if T > Tc, then Tc² < T², so (Tc²/T²) is less than 1, so 6*(Tc²/T²) <6, and 1- that would be negative.

So the calculation seems correct, leading to z=0.804.

Wait, but maybe I should consider that the fugacity coefficient sometimes is expressed differently. Wait, no, the fugacity coefficient φ is equal to z, so f=φ P.

So f=50 *0.804=40.2 atm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of T. The problem states 150°C, which is 150 + 273.15=323.15 K. Let me use more precise numbers.

Let me recompute using more precise numbers.

T=323.15 K.

So T_c=304.3 K, T=323.15 K.

Compute (T_c/T):304.3 /323.15≈0.9417.

So (P T_c)/(Pc T) = (50 *304.3) / (73.0 *323.15).

Compute numerator:50 *304.3=15,215.

Denominator:73 *323.15.

Compute 73 *323.15:

73 *300=21,900.

73 *23.15= approx 73*23=1,679; 73*0.15=10.95 → total 1,679+10.95=1,689.95.

So total denominator:21,900+1,689.95=23,589.95.

So (15,215)/(23,589.95)≈0.6452.

So that's correct.

Next, [1 -6*(Tc²/T²)].

Compute Tc²=304.3^2=92,598.49.

T^2=323.15^2.

Compute 323.15^2:

323 *323=104,329 (as before). Then, 0.15^2=0.0225. And cross terms: 2*323*0.15=96.9.

So T^2= (323 +0.15)^2=323^2 +2*323*0.15 +0.15^2=104,329 +96.9 +0.0225=104,425.9225.

So T_c²/T²=92,598.49 /104,425.9225≈0.8873.

So 6*(Tc²/T²)=6*0.8873≈5.3238.

So 1-5.3238≈-4.3238.

So [9/128] * [0.6452] * [-4.3238].

Compute 9/128=0.0703125.

0.0703125 *0.6452≈0.0703125 *0.6=0.0421875; 0.0703125 *0.0452≈0.003178 → total≈0.045365.

Then, 0.045365 * (-4.3238)= let's compute this.

0.045365 *4=0.18146.

0.045365 *0.3238≈approx 0.01471.

So total ≈0.18146 +0.01471=0.19617.

So with the negative sign, it's -0.19617.

So z=1 + (-0.19617)=0.80383.

So z≈0.8038.

Fugacity f= z *P=0.8038 *50≈40.19 atm.

Hmm, but the options don't have 40.19. The closest is B:37.8, which is 40.19 is not close enough. Maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (PT_c)/(Pc T). Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 73 *323.15:

73 *300=21,900.

73 *23.15=73*(20 +3.15)=73*20=1,460; 73*3=219; 73*0.15=10.95 → total 1,460 +219=1,679 +10.95=1,689.95.

So 73 *323.15=21,900 +1,689.95=23,589.95.

So (50 *304.3)=15,215.

So 15,215 /23,589.95≈0.6452.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this division more accurately.

23,589.95 is approximately 23,590.

15,215 ÷23,590.

Let me compute 23,590 *0.645= ?

0.6 *23,590=14,154.

0.04 *23,590=943.6.

0.005 *23,590=117.95.

So 23,590 *0.645=14,154 +943.6=15,097.6 +117.95=15,215.55.

Oh, wow, that's very close to the numerator 15,215.

So 23,590 *0.645≈15,215.55.

So 15,215 /23,590≈0.645 exactly.

So (PT_c)/(Pc T)=0.645.

So that part is correct.

Next, the term [1 -6*(Tc²/T²)].

We have Tc²=92,598.49, T²=104,425.92.

So Tc²/T²=92,598.49/104,425.92≈0.8873.

Multiply by 6:5.3238.

1-5.3238= -4.3238.

So that's correct.

So the term [9/128]*[0.645]*[-4.3238] = 0.0703125 *0.645 * (-4.3238).

Compute 0.0703125 *0.645.

0.07 *0.645=0.04515.

0.0003125 *0.645=0.0002015625.

Total=0.04515+0.0002015625≈0.0453515625.

Now, multiply by -4.3238.

0.0453515625 *4.3238 ≈ let's compute:

0.04 *4.3238=0.17295.

0.0053515625 *4.3238≈0.02322.

So total≈0.17295 +0.02322=0.19617.

With the negative sign, it's -0.19617.

So z=1 -0.19617=0.80383.

So fugacity f=50 *0.80383≈40.19 atm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the equation is written as z = 1 + [9/(128)] * [ (P T_c)/(P_c T) ] * [1 - 6 (T_c² / T²)].

Wait, another thought: perhaps the equation is supposed to be [1 - 6*(T_c²)/(T^2)] but maybe it's [1 - 6*(T_c/T)^2], which would be different.

Wait, but the given equation is [1 -6{(T_c^2)/(T^2)}], which is the same as 1-6*(T_c²/T²).

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the Berthelot equation isn't applicable here, but the question says it obeys the reduced Berthelot equation reasonably well.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the fugacity coefficient differently.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the fugacity is given by z, but perhaps I have to calculate the fugacity as f = z * (RT/v), but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the fugacity f is defined as f = φ P, where φ is the fugacity coefficient, which is equal to z in this case. Because the fugacity coefficient φ is given by z = φ, so f=φ P.

So that should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 9/128. Let me check.

9 divided by 128: 128/9≈14.222, so 1/14.222≈0.0703125. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used 9/128 as 0.0703125, which I did.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the pressure is in the correct units. The problem states P=50 atm, and P_c=73.0 atm. So the units are consistent.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the fugacity is given by z * P, but perhaps the equation is written differently.

Wait, perhaps the equation is z = (PV)/(RT) = 1 + [9/(128)] * [(P T_c)/(P_c T)] * [1 -6 (T_c²/T²)].

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation in terms of reduced variables.

Reduced pressure Pr = P / P_c =50/73≈0.6849.

Reduced temperature Tr = T / T_c =323 /304.3≈1.0615.

Then, the equation can be written as z =1 + [9/128]*(Pr / Tr) * [1 -6*(1/Tr²)].

Wait, because (P T_c)/(P_c T)= (P/P_c) * (T_c/T) = Pr * (1/Tr).

So [ (P T_c)/(P_c T) ] = Pr / Tr.

So the equation becomes:

z=1 + (9/128)*(Pr/Tr)*(1 -6*(1/Tr²)).

Let me compute each part:

Pr=50/73≈0.6849.

Tr=323/304.3≈1.0615.

So Pr/Tr≈0.6849 /1.0615≈0.6453.

Which matches the earlier calculation.

Then, 1 -6*(1/Tr²)=1 -6*(1/(1.0615)^2).

Compute (1.0615)^2≈1.127.

So 6*(1/1.127)=6*(0.888)=5.328.

So 1-5.328= -4.328.

So that's correct.

So the terms are the same as before.

Thus, the calculation seems correct, leading to z≈0.804, f≈40.2 atm.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the equation is written differently. Let me check the equation again.

The question states: z = [(PV)/(RT)] = 1 + [9/(128)] [(PT_c)/(P_cT)] [1 - 6 {(T_c^2)/(T^2)}].

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when T > Tc, the term becomes negative, leading to z <1, which makes sense for real gases, as they are more compressible than ideal gases at high pressures, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again. Wait, the options are:

A:60.5

B:37.8

C:50

D:73.0

E:88.1

F:25.6

G:46.4

H:304.3

I:55.2

Hmm, none is close to 40.2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using exact values without approximations.

Let me compute each part with more precision.

Compute (P T_c)/(P_c T) = (50 *304.3)/(73 *323).

Compute numerator:50 *304.3=15,215.

Denominator:73 *323=73*(300+23)=73*300=21,900; 73*23=1,679 → total=23,579.

So 15,215 /23,579=?

Let me compute this division more accurately.

23,579 *0.645= ?

0.6 *23,579=14,147.4

0.04 *23,579=943.16

0.005 *23,579=117.895

Total=14,147.4 +943.16=15,090.56 +117.895=15,208.455.

So 23,579 *0.645=15,208.455.

The numerator is 15,215, which is 15,215 -15,208.455=6.545 more.

So 6.545 /23,579 ≈0.0002775.

So (50*304.3)/(73*323)=0.645 +0.0002775≈0.6452775.

So approximately 0.6452775.

Next, compute [1 -6*(T_c²/T²)].

T_c=304.3 K, T=323 K.

T_c²=304.3^2=92,598.49.

T²=323^2=104,329.

So T_c²/T²=92,598.49 /104,329=0.888 exactly.

Wait, 92,598.49 ÷104,329=0.888 exactly? Let me compute 104,329 *0.888=?

104,329 *0.8=83,463.2

104,329 *0.08=8,346.32

104,329 *0.008=834.632

Adding up: 83,463.2 +8,346.32=91,809.52 +834.632=92,644.152.

Wait, but 104,329 *0.888=92,644.152, which is more than 92,598.49. So 0.888 is slightly higher than the actual value.

So let me compute 92,598.49 /104,329.

Let me compute 104,329 *0.888=92,644.152.

But our T_c² is 92,598.49, which is 92,598.49 /104,329=?

So 92,598.49 =0.888 *104,329 - (92,644.152 -92,598.49)=92,644.152-92,598.49=45.662.

So 92,598.49=0.888 *104,329 -45.662.

So 92,598.49=104,329*(0.888) -45.662.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 92,598.49 ÷104,329.

Let me compute 104,329 *0.88=?

104,329 *0.8=83,463.2

104,329 *0.08=8,346.32 → total=91,809.52.

So 0.88 gives 91,809.52.

Difference:92,598.49 -91,809.52=788.97.

Now, 788.97 /104,329≈0.00756.

So 0.88 +0.00756≈0.88756.

So T_c²/T²≈0.88756.

So 6*(T_c²/T²)=6*0.88756≈5.32536.

Thus, [1 -5.32536]= -4.32536.

Now, compute [9/128] * [0.6452775] * [-4.32536].

Compute 9/128=0.0703125.

Multiply by 0.6452775: 0.0703125 *0.6452775.

Let me compute this accurately.

0.07 *0.6452775=0.045169425.

0.0003125 *0.6452775=0.00020165.

Total=0.045169425 +0.00020165≈0.045371075.

Now, multiply by -4.32536.

0.045371075 *4.32536.

Compute 0.04 *4.32536=0.1730144.

0.005371075 *4.32536≈0.023319.

So total≈0.1730144 +0.023319≈0.196333.

With the negative sign, it's -0.196333.

So z=1 + (-0.196333)=0.803667.

So z≈0.80367.

Thus, fugacity f=50 *0.80367≈40.1835 atm.

Hmm, still around 40.18 atm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the equation is z = [(PV)/(RT)] = 1 + [9/(128)] * [ (P T_c)/(P_c T) ] * [1 +6 (T_c^2)/(T^2)].

Wait, no, the given equation is [1 -6 (T_c^2/T^2)].

Wait, perhaps I should have used [1 +6 (T_c^2/T^2)] instead. Let me try that.

If that's the case, then:

[1 +6*(T_c²/T²)]=1 +6*(0.88756)=1+5.32536=6.32536.

Then, the calculation becomes:

[9/128] * [0.6452775] * [6.32536].

So 0.0703125 *0.6452775=0.045371075.

Multiply by 6.32536:

0.045371075 *6 =0.27222645.

0.045371075 *0.32536≈0.01473.

So total≈0.27222645 +0.01473≈0.28695.

So z=1 +0.28695=1.28695.

Fugacity f=1.28695 *50≈64.3475 atm.

But that's not an option either. The closest option is A:60.5.

Wait, perhaps the equation has a plus instead of a minus. Let me check the original equation again.

The equation is z = ... [1 -6 (T_c²/T²)].

Yes, it's a minus. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when T > Tc, the fugacity coefficient is less than 1, which matches our earlier calculation of z=0.804.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem expects me to make an approximation or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the fugacity is calculated differently. Wait, perhaps I should compute the fugacity as f = P * exp( [9/(128)] * [(PT_c)/(P_c T)] * [1 -6 (T_c²/T²)] ), but I don't think that's the case. The question states z = 1 + [9/(128)] * ... .

Wait, perhaps the equation is for the compressibility factor Z, and fugacity coefficient φ = Z. So f=φ P.

So I think I did it right.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are:

A:60.5

B:37.8

C:50

D:73.0

E:88.1

F:25.6

G:46.4

H:304.3

I:55.2

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [9/(128)] * [0.645] * [-4.328].

Let me compute 9/(128)=0.0703125.

Multiply by 0.645: 0.0703125 *0.645=0.04537.

Multiply by -4.328: 0.04537 * (-4.328)= -0.196.

So z=1-0.196=0.804.

So f=50 *0.804=40.2 atm.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the equation is expressed differently, such as using different constants.

Wait, perhaps the equation is z=1 + (9/(128)) * (P T_c)/(P_c T) * (1 -6 (T_c/T)^2).

Wait, let me compute (T_c/T)=304.3/323≈0.9417.

So (T_c/T)^2≈0.887.

So 6*(T_c/T)^2≈5.323.

So 1-5.323≈-4.323.

Which is the same as before.

So no change.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if I used the correct temperature. The problem states 150°C, which is 323 K. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the exact values without any approximation.

But it's leading me to the same result.

Wait, perhaps the equation is supposed to be multiplied by 2 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the fugacity coefficient is the other way around, like φ=1/z. But that would make φ=1.244, leading to f=62.2 atm, which is close to option A:60.5.

But that doesn't make sense because when z<1, φ=z<1, so fugacity is less than pressure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and it's z=1 + [...] but perhaps the equation is written as z=1 - [...] which would make the term positive.

Wait, but the given equation is z=1 + [9/(128)] * [...] * [1 -6*(T_c²/T²)].

So if [1 -6*(T_c²/T²)] is negative, then the entire term becomes negative, leading to z<1.

But perhaps I should compute without the negative sign. Let me try that.

If I compute [1 -6*(T_c²/T²)] as positive 4.328, then:

z=1 + (9/128)*0.645*4.328.

Compute 9/128=0.0703125.

0.0703125 *0.645=0.04537.

0.04537 *4.328≈0.196.

So z=1+0.196=1.196.

Thus, f=50 *1.196≈59.8 atm, which is close to option A:60.5 atm.

But why would I ignore the negative sign? Because perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [1 -6*(T_c²/T²)].

Wait, perhaps I should recompute [1 -6*(T_c²/T²)].

T_c=304.3, T=323.

T_c²=92,598.49.

T²=104,329.

So T_c²/T²=92,598.49/104,329≈0.888.

6*(0.888)=5.328.

So 1-5.328=-4.328.

That's correct.

So I can't ignore the negative sign.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written as z=1 + [9/(128)] * [(P T_c)/(P_c T)] * [1 +6*(T_c²/T²)].

If that's the case, then [1 +6*(0.888)]=1+5.328=6.328.

Then, [9/128]=0.0703125.

Multiply by 0.645:0.0703125 *0.645=0.04537.

Multiply by 6.328:0.04537 *6.328≈0.286.

So z=1+0.286=1.286.

F=50 *1.286≈64.3 atm, which is close to option A:60.5, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation uses (T/Tc) instead of (Tc/T). Let me compute that.

If the equation is [1 -6*(T/Tc)^2], then (T/Tc)=323/304.3≈1.0615.

So (T/Tc)^2≈1.127.

So 6*(1.127)=6.763.

So 1 -6.763= -5.763.

Then, the term becomes:

[9/128] *0.645 * (-5.763)=0.0703125 *0.645=0.04537.

0.04537 * (-5.763)= -0.260.

So z=1-0.260=0.74.

Thus, f=50 *0.74=37 atm, which is close to option B:37.8.

Hmm, that's possible. Maybe I misread the equation.

Wait, the given equation has [1 -6{(T_c^2)/(T^2)}]. So I think I did it correctly.

But perhaps the equation is [1 -6{(T^2)/(T_c^2)}], which would be [1 -6*(T²/Tc²)].

In that case, T²/Tc²=(323/304.3)^2≈(1.0615)^2≈1.127.

So 6*(1.127)=6.763.

So [1 -6.763]= -5.763.

Then, the term becomes:

[9/128] *0.645 * (-5.763)=0.0703125 *0.645=0.04537.

0.04537 * (-5.763)= -0.260.

So z=1 -0.260=0.74.

f=50 *0.74=37 atm, which is close to option B:37.8.

So perhaps I misread the equation, and it's [1 -6*(T²/Tc²)] instead of [1 -6*(Tc²/T²)].

If that's the case, the answer would be around 37 atm, which is option B:37.8.

But the question states [1 -6{(T_c^2)/(T^2)}], so I think I did it correctly.

This is confusing. Perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fugacity is calculated using the virial equation, but the question says to use the reduced Berthelot equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation that at high pressures, the fugacity approaches Pc, but that doesn't make sense here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the ideal gas value, but that's 50 atm, which is option C. But the question states to use the equation, so that's not correct.

Hmm. Given that none of the options match my calculation, but option B is 37.8, which is close to 37, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is B:37.8.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the fugacity of carbon dioxide at 150°C and 50 atm using the reduced Berthelot equation:

\[
z = 1 + \frac{9}{128} \cdot \frac{P T_c}{P_c T} \cdot \left[ 1 - 6 \frac{T_c^2}{T^2} \right]
\]

### Given Data:
- \( T_c = 304.3 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P_c = 73.0 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( T = 150^\circ \text{C} = 323 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P = 50 \, \text{atm} \)

### Step 1: Compute \( \frac{P T_c}{P_c T} \)
\[
\frac{P T_c}{P_c T} = \frac{50 \cdot 304.3}{73.0 \cdot 323} \approx 0.645
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \frac{T_c^2}{T^2} \)
\[
T_c^2 = 304.3^2 \approx 92,598.49, \quad T^2 = 323^2 \approx 104,329
\]
\[
\frac{T_c^2}{T^2} = \frac{92,598.49}{104,329} \approx 0.888
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( 1 - 6 \frac{T_c^2}{T^2} \)
\[
1 - 6 \cdot 0.888 = 1 - 5.328 = -4.328
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \frac{9}{128} \cdot 0.645 \cdot (-4.328) \)
\[
\frac{9}{128} \approx 0.0703125, \quad 0.0703125 \cdot 0.645 \approx 0.04537, \quad 0.04537 \cdot (-4.328) \approx -0.196
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( z \)
\[
z = 1 + (-0.196) = 0.804
\]

### Step 6: Compute Fugacity \( f \)
\[
f = z \cdot P = 0.804 \cdot 50 \approx 40.2 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Analysis of Options:
The calculated fugacity (\( f \approx 40.2 \, \text{atm} \)) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **B: 37.8 atm**, which may account for rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The most reasonable answer, based on the given options, is:

**B: 37.8 atm**

B
