Question:

 Construct a complete truth table for the following argument. Then, using the truth table, determine whether the argument is valid or invalid. If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample. (There may be other counterexamples as well.)

(A ∨ C) ∨ B / C

Options:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when A, B, and C are all true
B: Invalid. Counterexample when A, B, and C are all false
C: Invalid. Counterexample when A and B are true and C is false
D: Invalid. Counterexample when B is true and A and C are false
E: Invalid. Counterexample when A and C are true and B is false
F: Invalid. Counterexample when A is true and B and C are false
G: Invalid. Counterexample when A is false and B and C are true
H: Valid
I: Invalid. Counterexample when C is true and A and B are false

Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve. It's about constructing a truth table for a given argument and then determining if the argument is valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided.

The argument given is:

~A · ~B
(A ∨ C) ∨ B / C

Hmm, let me break this down. The premises are ~A · ~B (which is the same as ~A ∧ ~B) and (A ∨ C) ∨ B. The conclusion is C. So the argument is: If not A and not B, and either A or C is true or B is true, then C must be true.

I think I should construct the truth table step by step. There are three propositional variables: A, B, and C. Each can be either true or false, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations.

First, I'll list all possible truth values for A, B, and C. Then, compute the truth values for each premise and the conclusion.

Let me outline the columns I'll need:

1. A
2. B
3. C
4. ~A (not A)
5. ~B (not B)
6. ~A · ~B (premise 1)
7. (A ∨ C) (part of premise 2)
8. (A ∨ C) ∨ B (premise 2)
9. C (conclusion)

Wait, maybe I should compute each part step by step.

Starting with row 1: A=T, B=T, C=T

Compute ~A: F
~B: F
~A · ~B: F ∧ F = F
(A ∨ C): T ∨ T = T
(A ∨ C) ∨ B: T ∨ T = T
Conclusion: C=T

So for premise 1: F, premise 2: T. The argument is valid only if in every row where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true. So I need to check if whenever premise1 and premise2 are both true, conclusion C is true.

Wait, in this row, premise1 is false, so it doesn't affect the validity. I can ignore this row for checking validity.

Row 2: A=T, B=T, C=F

~A: F
~B: F
~A · ~B: F
(A ∨ C): T ∨ F = T
(A ∨ C) ∨ B: T ∨ T = T
Conclusion: C=F

Here, premises are F and T. Since premise1 is F, we don't consider this for validity.

Row 3: A=T, B=F, C=T

~A: F
~B: T
~A · ~B: F ∧ T = F
(A ∨ C): T ∨ T = T
(A ∨ C) ∨ B: T ∨ F = T
Conclusion: T

Again, premise1 is F, so no issue.

Row 4: A=T, B=F, C=F

~A: F
~B: T
~A · ~B: F
(A ∨ C): T ∨ F = T
(A ∨ C) ∨ B: T ∨ F = T
Conclusion: F

Premise1 is F, so no problem.

Row 5: A=F, B=T, C=T

~A: T
~B: F
~A · ~B: T ∧ F = F
(A ∨ C): F ∨ T = T
(A ∨ C) ∨ B: T ∨ T = T
Conclusion: T

Premise1 is F, so okay.

Row 6: A=F, B=T, C=F

~A: T
~B: F
~A · ~B: F
(A ∨ C): F ∨ F = F
(A ∨ C) ∨ B: F ∨ T = T
Conclusion: F

Here, premise1 is F, so not relevant.

Row 7: A=F, B=F, C=T

~A: T
~B: T
~A · ~B: T ∧ T = T
(A ∨ C): F ∨ T = T
(A ∨ C) ∨ B: T ∨ F = T
Conclusion: T

Now, both premises are true (premise1=T, premise2=T), and conclusion=T. So no problem here.

Row 8: A=F, B=F, C=F

~A: T
~B: T
~A · ~B: T ∧ T = T
(A ∨ C): F ∨ F = F
(A ∨ C) ∨ B: F ∨ F = F
Conclusion: F

Here, premise1=T, premise2=F. So only when both premises are true do we check the conclusion. In this case, premise2 is F, so it doesn't affect the validity.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in premise2 for row8. Let me recheck.

In row8: A=F, B=F, C=F.

(A ∨ C) is F ∨ F = F.

Then (A ∨ C) ∨ B is F ∨ F = F.

So premise2 is F. So even though premise1 is T, since premise2 is F, the premises are not both true, so no issue.

So now, I need to check all rows where both premises are true. From the 8 rows, which ones have premise1=T and premise2=T?

Looking back, row7: premise1=T, premise2=T, conclusion=T. So that's fine.

Any other rows where both premises are T? Let me check.

Row1: premise1=F, premise2=T → no.

Row2: premise1=F, premise2=T → no.

Row3: premise1=F, premise2=T → no.

Row4: premise1=F, premise2=T → no.

Row5: premise1=F, premise2=T → no.

Row6: premise1=F, premise2=T → no.

Row7: yes.

Row8: premise1=T, premise2=F → no.

So the only row where both premises are true is row7, and in that case, conclusion is T. So the argument would be valid because in every case where premises are true, conclusion is true.

Wait, but the options include H: Valid, so that's an option. But let me double-check because sometimes I might have missed a row.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the premises. Let me re-examine the premises.

The premises are:

1. ~A ∧ ~B

2. (A ∨ C) ∨ B

Wait, the second premise is (A ∨ C) ∨ B. That's equivalent to A ∨ C ∨ B, which is the same as A ∨ B ∨ C. So premise2 is true if at least one of A, B, or C is true.

So in row7: A=F, B=F, C=T → premise2 is T.

In row8: A=F, B=F, C=F → premise2 is F.

So in row7, both premises are T, conclusion is T.

Is there any other row where both premises are T?

Let me check row1 again: A=T, B=T, C=T.

Premise1: ~A ∧ ~B → F ∧ F = F.

Premise2: (A ∨ C) ∨ B → T ∨ T = T.

So premises are F and T, so no.

Row2: A=T, B=T, C=F.

Premise1: F.

Row3: A=T, B=F, C=T.

Premise1: F.

Row4: A=T, B=F, C=F.

Premise1: F.

Row5: A=F, B=T, C=T.

Premise1: F.

Row6: A=F, B=T, C=F.

Premise1: F.

So the only row where both premises are T is row7. Therefore, the argument is valid because whenever premises are true, conclusion is true.

But wait, the options have H as Valid, so that's the answer. But wait, I must have made a mistake because the options include multiple invalid options, which suggests the argument is invalid. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me check again. Let's consider the argument:

Premise1: ~A ∧ ~B

Premise2: (A ∨ C) ∨ B → which is equivalent to A ∨ B ∨ C.

Conclusion: C.

So the argument is: If not A and not B, and either A, B, or C is true, then C must be true.

Wait, but if ~A ∧ ~B is true, then A=F and B=F. So in that case, premise2 becomes (F ∨ C) ∨ F → which simplifies to C. So premise2 is equivalent to C when ~A ∧ ~B is true.

So when ~A ∧ ~B is true, premise2 is C. So the argument becomes: If (not A and not B) and C, then C. Which is trivially true because if C is part of the premises, the conclusion C must follow.

Wait, but that suggests that whenever premise1 is true, premise2 is equivalent to C. So the argument would be: If (not A and not B) and C, then C. Which is a tautology because the premises include C, so the conclusion must be C.

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me think again.

When premise1 is true, A=F and B=F. So premise2 is (A ∨ C) ∨ B → (F ∨ C) ∨ F → C ∨ F → C. So premise2 becomes C.

So the premises together are ~A ∧ ~B (premise1) and C (premise2). So the argument is: If (~A ∧ ~B) and C, then C. Which is trivially valid because the conclusion is the same as part of the premises.

Wait, but that would make the argument valid, which would mean the answer is H: Valid.

But let me check the truth table again. Let's go through each row where premise1 is T.

Only row7: A=F, B=F, C=T.

In this case, premises are T and T, conclusion is T.

So the argument is valid because in the only case where the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.

But wait, the options include H: Valid, so that's the answer. But the user provided options up to I, and H is one of them. So the answer would be H.

But wait, the initial problem statement says "construct a complete truth table for the following argument. Then, using the truth table, determine whether the argument is valid or invalid."

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I structured the premises. Let me make sure.

The argument is written as:

~A · ~B
(A ∨ C) ∨ B / C

So the premises are ~A · ~B and (A ∨ C) ∨ B, and the conclusion is C.

Wait, but in the truth table, when I checked all the rows, the only time both premises are true is when A=F, B=F, C=T. In that case, conclusion is T.

So yes, the argument is valid because in the only case where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true.

Therefore, the answer should be H: Valid.

The argument is valid because in the only row where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true.

Answer: H
