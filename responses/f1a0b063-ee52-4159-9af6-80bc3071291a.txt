Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about dividends for preferred and common stock. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The company, Novelco, has two types of stock: cumulative preferred stock and common stock. There are 1,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $100 each. They pay dividends at 6%. Then there are 20,000 shares of common stock.

In the first two years, the company didn't pay any dividends in the first year and paid $14,000 in the second year. I need to find out how much each class (preferred and common) gets each year.

Hmm, I remember that preferred stock dividends are usually cumulative, which means if the company doesn't pay them in a year, they carry over to the next year. Common stocks don't get dividends until preferred dividends are paid in full.

So first, let's calculate the annual preferred dividend. The preferred stock has a par value of $100 and a 6% dividend rate. So each preferred share pays 6% of $100, which is $6 per share. Since there are 1,000 shares, the total preferred dividend per year is 1,000 * $6 = $6,000.

Now, looking at the years:

First year: Dividends available were $0. So they couldn't pay the $6,000 preferred dividend. That means the preferred stockholders are owed $6,000, and that's carried over to the next year.

Second year: Dividends available are $14,000. Now, the company must first pay the preferred dividends for both the first and second years, and then any remaining goes to common stock.

Wait, but the question is asking for the dividends per year, not the total over two years. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Wait, no, the question says the company had the amounts available for dividends in each year. So first year: $0, second year: $14,000.

So in the first year, they can't pay anything. So preferred gets nothing that year, but the arrears accumulate. But in the second year, they have $14,000. They must pay the preferred dividends for both the first and second year plus any arrears.

Wait, no. Because the preferred is cumulative, so each year's preferred dividend is due. So in year one, they couldn't pay the $6,000, so that's an arrear. In year two, they have $14,000. They need to pay the $6,000 for year two, plus the $6,000 from year one. So total preferred to pay is $12,000. Then the remaining $2,000 would go to common stock.

Wait, but the question is about each year's dividends. So in year one, since they have $0, preferred gets $0, common gets $0. In year two, they have $14,000. They must pay the preferred for both years, right?

Wait no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The question seems to be asking for the total dividends per year for each class, not per share. So for each year, how much each class gets.

Wait, perhaps the way to think about it is:

Each year, the company can pay dividends if they have the money. For preferred, they get their dividend first, then common.

In year one: Available $0. So no dividends to anyone. So preferred gets $0, common gets $0.

In year two: Available $14,000. They must pay preferred for year two: $6,000. But also, since it's cumulative, they must pay the missed $6,000 from year one. So total preferred to pay is $12,000. Then, any remaining goes to common.

So in year two: $14,000 total. $12,000 to preferred, $2,000 to common.

Wait, but the question says "find the dividends per year for each class." So perhaps it's asking for the total dividends each class received over the two years.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "dividends per year for each class of stock." So for each year, what was the dividend for each class.

So first year: preferred gets $0, common gets $0.

Second year: preferred gets $12,000 (because they have to catch up year one and pay year two), but the company only has $14,000. So 14,000 - 12,000 leaves $2,000 for common.

So over two years, preferred would have $12,000 (6,000 each year, but only paid in the second year), and common gets $2,000 in the second year.

Wait, but the options are per year. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, E is $12,000 for preferred and $2,000 for common. That seems to match what I calculated for the second year, but the first year would have 0. But the question is asking for the dividends per year for each class. So perhaps it's for each year, but the options seem to present the totals.

Wait, no, the options are giving the total per year for each class. So in the second year, preferred gets $12k and common $2k, but the first year, both got 0.

But looking at the options, option E says $12,000 for preferred and $2,000 for common. That would be for the second year, but the first year both got 0. Wait, but the question is about the dividends per year for each class, so perhaps it's the total over the two years.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me restate:

Each year, the company can pay up to the amount available.

Year 1: $0 available. So preferred's dividend is $6,000 but not paid. Common gets 0.

Year 2: $14,000 available. The company must first pay the preferred dividends for both years plus any arrears.

Wait, no. Because the preferred is cumulative, the company can only avoid paying a year's dividend if they can't, but the arrears accumulate. So in year 2, they must pay the $6,000 for year 2 first, but also pay the $6,000 arrears from year 1. So total preferred dividend for year 2 is $12,000. Then, the remaining $2,000 goes to common.

So in year 2, preferred gets $12,000, common $2,000.

So the question is, for each year, what's the dividend. So in year 1, preferred 0, common 0. Year 2: preferred $12k, common $2k. But the options don't have this structure. They seem to present the total for each class over the two years, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says "dividends per year for each class." So perhaps it's asking for the amount each class received each year. So for each year separately.

Year 1: both get 0.

Year 2: preferred gets $12k, common $2k.

But the options don't have this. The options give a single pair, like option E is $12k preferred and $2k common. So perhaps the question is asking for the total for each class over the two years.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the options are presented as per year. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total for each class per year, meaning the amount each gets each year.

But in that case, the correct answer would be that in year 1, both get 0, and in year 2, preferred gets $12k and common $2k. But the options don't reflect that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total dividends paid to each class in each year where the company paid. So in year 2, they paid $14k. So preferred gets their $12k, common $2k. So the answer would be, for the two years, preferred received $12k in year 2, and common $2k.

But the options are presented as per year. So perhaps the correct answer is E: $12,000 for preferred and $2,000 for common. That would be the case in the second year.

Wait, but the question says "dividends per year for each class of stock." So perhaps it's asking for the amount each class receives each year, but the options are giving the total for each class across the two years.

I'm a bit confused, but looking at the options, E is the only one where preferred gets $12k and common $2k. That must be the correct answer.

The Novelco Corporation has 1,000 shares of cumulative preferred stock with a par value of $100 per share and a 6% dividend rate, totaling $6,000 in annual preferred dividends. In the first year, no dividends were paid, leaving $6,000 in arrears. In the second year, $14,000 was available for dividends. The company must first pay the $6,000 preferred dividend for the second year and the $6,000 arrears from the first year, totaling $12,000 for preferred stock. The remaining $2,000 is allocated to common stock. 

Thus, in the second year, preferred stock receives $12,000 and common stock receives $2,000.
