Question:

Define `marginalism' (as used in economics).

Options:

A: Marginalism is the study of economic trends.
B: Marginalism is the method of analysis that assesses the impact of changes in production volume on total satisfaction.
C: Marginalism is the method of analysis focusing on the first unit in production.
D: Marginalism is the study of how market prices are established by the intersection of supply and demand curves.
E: Marginalism is the theory that all units in production have equal value.
F: Marginalism is the practice of increasing production by one unit to assess cost changes.
G: Marginalism is the concept that the value of a good is determined by its historical cost.
H: Marginalism is the method of analysis that concentrates attention on the last unit in production or consumption.
I: Marginalism is the method of analysis that ignores the last unit in production or consumption.
J: Marginalism is the economic principle that prioritizes the most abundant resources.

Okay, so I have this question about marginalism in economics, and I need to figure out the correct definition from the given options. Let me start by recalling what I know about marginalism.

I remember that marginalism is a concept in economics that deals with the idea of marginal utility or marginal cost. From my studies, marginal utility refers to the additional satisfaction or benefit that a consumer gets from consuming one more unit of a good or service. Similarly, marginal cost is the additional cost incurred by producing one more unit. So, marginalism seems to focus on these incremental changes rather than the overall or total.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Study of economic trends. That doesn't sound right. Trends are more about patterns over time, not about marginal analysis.

Option B: Impact of changes in production volume on total satisfaction. Hmm, this is somewhat related but seems broader. Marginalism is more about the impact of each additional unit, not the entire volume.

Option C: Focus on the first unit. No, I think it's the opposite. Marginalism is about the last or additional unit, not the first.

Option D: How market prices are set by supply and demand. While supply and demand do determine prices, that's more about equilibrium pricing, not specifically marginalism.

Option E: All units have equal value. That doesn't fit because marginalism is about varying values as more units are consumed or produced.

Option F: Increasing production by one unit to assess cost changes. This is closer, as it mentions one unit for cost. But I think marginalism is more about the last unit's impact on satisfaction or cost.

Option G: Value determined by historical cost. That's more related to accounting or cost accounting, not economic marginalism.

Option H: Concentrates on the last unit in production or consumption. This aligns with what I remember. Marginalism is about the additional, last unit's effect on utility or cost.

Option I: Ignores the last unit. That's the opposite of H, so probably incorrect.

Option J: Prioritizes abundant resources. I don't think that's related to marginalism.

So, putting it together, option H seems correct because it's about focusing on the last unit's impact, whether in production or consumption. That's the essence of marginalismâ€”the analysis of the marginal (additional) unit.

The correct answer is H, as marginalism focuses on the last unit's impact in production or consumption.

Answer: H
