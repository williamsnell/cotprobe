Question:

A container ship has a cross-sectional area of 3,000 m^2 at the water line when the draft is 9m. What weight of containers can be added before the normal draft of 9.2m is reached. Assume salt water of weight density 10kN/m^3.

Options:

A: 8000kN
B: 7000kN
C: 9000kN
D: 4000kN
E: 6000kN
F: 11000kN
G: 5000kN
H: 2000kN
I: 3000kN
J: 10000kN

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a container ship and figuring out how much more weight in containers can be added before the draft increases from 9m to 9.2m. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the principles, but let's think this through step by step.

First, I remember that the draft of a ship is the depth of the water it displaces. The weight of the displaced water is equal to the weight of the ship plus its cargo. So when they talk about adding more containers, the ship will displace more water, increasing the draft.

The question gives me the cross-sectional area at the waterline, which is 3,000 m². So when the draft increases by 0.2 meters (from 9m to 9.2m), the volume of water displaced will increase. The formula for the volume change is area multiplied by the change in draft. So that should be 3,000 m² * 0.2 m = 600 m³. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. The cross-sectional area at the waterline is given, so when the draft increases, the additional volume displaced is that area times the increase in draft. So yeah, 3,000 times 0.2 is indeed 600 m³. 

Now, the weight of that displaced water would be the volume multiplied by the density of the water. The density given is 10 kN/m³. So the weight increase would be 600 m³ * 10 kN/m³. Let me do that math: 600 * 10 = 6,000 kN. 

Wait, but units are important here. The density is in kN per cubic meter, so when I multiply by volume in m³, I get kN, which is correct because the options are in kN. 

So the additional weight the ship can carry is 6,000 kN. Looking at the options, E is 6000kN. So that should be the correct answer. 

Let me double-check. The change in draft is 0.2m, area 3000 m², so 3000 * 0.2 = 600 m³. Multiply by density 10 kN/m³, gives 6000 kN. Yep, that seems right. So the answer should be E.

The problem involves calculating the additional weight a container ship can carry before its draft increases from 9m to 9.2m. The cross-sectional area at the waterline is 3,000 m², and the density of saltwater is 10 kN/m³. 

The change in draft is 0.2m, so the additional volume displaced is 3,000 m² * 0.2m = 600 m³. Multiplying this by the water density (10 kN/m³) gives 600 m³ * 10 kN/m³ = 6,000 kN. Therefore, the weight of containers that can be added is 6,000 kN.

Answer: E
