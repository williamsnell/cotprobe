Question:

Explain the development of an individual who is not psychologically well-adjusted, according to Rogers.

Options:

A: Rogers posits that consistent positive reinforcement leads to maladjustment as it prevents the development of a realistic self-concept.
B: Rogers believes that personal evaluations by others, especially during childhood, result in a distancing or incongruence between the experiences of the self and the experiences of the organism, leading to psychological maladjustment.
C: According to Rogers, the primary factor in psychological maladjustment is the individual's failure to achieve their full economic potential.
D: Rogers suggests that well-adjustment is hindered when an individual adopts the values of others as their own without question.
E: Rogers believes that evaluations by others have no impact on a child's psychological adjustment
F: Rogers believes that a lack of discipline and structure in childhood is the main contributor to psychological maladjustment.
G: Rogers asserts that psychological maladjustment arises primarily from an individual's inability to engage in abstract thinking.
H: Rogers believes that psychological well-being is determined solely by genetic factors, with environmental factors playing no role.
I: Rogers believes that the child's self-concept is always in congruence with the experiences of the organism
J: Rogers believes that the child's self-regard is always conditional

Alright, I need to figure out which option correctly explains how Rogers views the development of someone who isn't psychologically well-adjusted. I remember that Rogers' theory is centered around the concept of the self and how experiences shape our adjustment.

So, Rogers talked a lot about the self-concept and how it's developed through interactions with others. He believed that when a person receives positive regard unconditionally, it helps them develop a healthy self-concept. But if the regard is conditional, that can cause problems.

Looking at the options, option B says that Rogers believes personal evaluations by others, especially in childhood, lead to a distancing or incongruence between the self and their experiences. That sounds familiar. He talked about how when others evaluate us, especially parents or caregivers, if they are conditional in their love or approval, it can cause the self to become inconsistent with the organismic experience. This inconsistency leads to psychological maladjustment.

Option A says positive reinforcement leads to maladjustment. That doesn't seem right. Rogers actually thought that positive reinforcement without conditions was good. So A is probably wrong.

Option C mentions economic potential. I don't recall Rogers focusing on economic factors; he was more about emotional and psychological aspects. So C is out.

Option D talks about adopting others' values without question. While Rogers did discuss the impact of others' values, the main issue is about conditional positive regard leading to incongruence. So D might not be the best fit.

Option E says evaluations have no impact. That's the opposite of what Rogers believed, so E is incorrect.

Option F mentions lack of discipline. Rogers didn't emphasize structure and discipline as the main cause; he was more about the conditional nature of love and approval. So F is likely wrong.

Option G relates to abstract thinking. I don't think Rogers linked maladjustment to thinking abilities directly, so G is probably incorrect.

Option H says environment doesn't matter, which is wrong because Rogers emphasized both genetic and environmental factors, but especially the environment in terms of how others treat us.

Option I states self-concept is always congruent, which is the opposite of what Rogers said. He discussed incongruence as a problem, so I is wrong.

Option J says self-regard is always conditional. Rogers did talk about conditional vs. unconditional positive regard, but J seems to suggest it's always conditional, which isn't accurate because he advocated for unconditional regard to prevent maladjustment.

So, putting it all together, option B best captures Rogers' view that evaluations by others, especially during childhood, lead to a disconnect between the self and organismic experiences, causing maladjustment.

The correct answer is B. Rogers emphasizes that conditional positive reinforcement and evaluations by others, particularly in childhood, can lead to psychological maladjustment by creating a disconnect between the self-concept and the organismic experience.
