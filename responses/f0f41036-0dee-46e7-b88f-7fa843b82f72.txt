Question:

Contrast the meanings of the terms "gene pool" and "genotype\textquotedblright.

Options:

A: A gene pool is the genetic makeup present in the environment, while a genotype is the genetic makeup that an organism inherits from its parents.
B: A gene pool is the set of all genes within a single organism, while a genotype refers to the genetic variations among different populations.
C: A gene pool is the genetic constitution of an individual, while a genotype is the total genetic information in a population.
D: A gene pool is the collection of genes that predict an organism's phenotype, while a genotype is the combination of alleles that an organism possesses for a single trait.
E: A genotype is the unique genetic code found within a cell, while a gene pool encompasses the various genotypes that interact within an ecosystem.
F: Genotype refers to the breeding potential of a population, while a gene pool is the set of all possible genes that can be passed down through reproduction.
G: A gene pool and genotype both refer to the genetic constitution of an individual.
H: A gene pool and genotype both refer to the total genetic information in a population.
I: A gene pool is the total genetic information in a population, while a genotype is the genetic constitution of an individual.
J: A gene pool refers to a collection of physical traits in a population, while a genotype is the specific genetic makeup responsible for one particular trait.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the difference between "gene pool" and "genotype." I remember from my biology class that these terms are related to genetics, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definitions. Let me think through this step by step.

First, what is a genotype? I recall that the genotype refers to the specific genetic makeup of an individual. It's the combination of alleles that an organism has for a particular trait. For example, if we're talking about flower color, the genotype would be the specific genes inherited from each parent that determine that color. So genotype is something specific to an individual, right?

Now, what about a gene pool? I think the term gene pool is used to describe the collection of all the genes in a population. Like, if you have a group of plants, the gene pool would include all the genetic variation present in that group. It's more about the total genetic diversity available in a population. So a gene pool is bigger because it encompasses all the genes from all individuals in a population.

Wait, so genotype is individual, and gene pool is population-level. That makes sense. So looking at the options, I need to find the one that contrasts these two correctly.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A says a gene pool is genetic makeup in the environment, while genotype is what an organism inherits. Hmm, no. The gene pool isn't in the environment; it's within the population. So A might be incorrect.

Option B: gene pool is all genes in a single organism, genotype is variations among populations. No, that's backwards. Gene pool is across a population, not a single organism.

Option C: gene pool is individual's genetics, genotype is population's. No, that's opposite. Gene pool is for populations, genotype for individuals.

Option D: gene pool predicts phenotype, genotype is alleles for a trait. Not quite. Gene pool is about all genes in a population, not just predicting phenotype. Also, genotype is for a single trait, but gene pool is broader.

Option E: genotype is cell's unique code, gene pool is various genotypes in an ecosystem. Hmm, not exactly. Gene pool is within a population, not an ecosystem. Plus, genotype isn't just a cell's code; it's the individual's genetic makeup.

Option F: genotype is breeding potential, gene pool is possible genes passed down. Not sure. Maybe not the best fit.

Option G: both refer to genetic constitution of an individual. No, because gene pool is population, not individual.

Option H: both refer to total genetic info in a population. No, genotype is individual, so this is wrong.

Option I: gene pool is total genetic info in population, genotype is individual's genetic constitution. Yes, that seems right. Gene pool is the sum of all genes in a population, while genotype is what an individual has.

Option J: gene pool is physical traits in population, genotype is for a specific trait. No, gene pool is about genes, not traits. Plus, genotype is for a specific trait's genes.

So, the correct answer should be I. Gene pool is the total genetic info in a population, and genotype is the individual's genetic makeup.

The term "gene pool" refers to the total collection of genes present in a population, encompassing all the genetic diversity within that group. In contrast, "genotype" specifically describes the genetic makeup of an individual, including the combination of alleles they possess for various traits. Therefore, the correct contrast is that a gene pool is the total genetic information in a population, while a genotype is the genetic constitution of an individual.

Answer: I
