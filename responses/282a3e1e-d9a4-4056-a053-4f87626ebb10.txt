Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a lens projecting an image. Let me try to work through it step by step.

So, the setup is a lantern slide being projected onto a screen that's initially 160 feet away from the projector. The image on the screen is 100 times larger than the slide. Then, the screen moves 100 inches closer, and I need to find how much the lantern slide must be moved relative to the lens to keep the image sharp.

First, I remember that in optics, the lens formula is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance. Also, the magnification m is given by m = di/do.

In the initial setup, the image is 100 times larger, so m = 100. So, m = di/do = 100. That means di = 100 * do.

The screen is 160 feet away. Wait, I should convert that to inches because the movement is in inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 160 feet is 160 * 12 = 1920 inches. So initially, di is 1920 inches.

Wait, no. Wait, in the problem, the screen is 160 ft away, so that's di, the image distance. So di_initial = 1920 inches.

Since m = di/do = 100, then do_initial = di_initial / 100 = 1920 / 100 = 19.2 inches. So initially, the object (slide) is 19.2 inches from the lens.

Now, the screen moves 100 inches closer. So the new image distance is di_final = 1920 - 100 = 1820 inches.

Wait, no, wait. The initial distance is 160 ft, which is 1920 inches. The screen moves 100 inches closer, so the new distance is 1920 - 100 = 1820 inches. So di_final = 1820 inches.

Now, we need to find the new object distance, do_final, such that the image remains in focus. The magnification would change, but since the screen's position changes, the magnification will adjust accordingly. But the question is about how much the slide must move relative to the lens.

So, using the lens formula again: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

But wait, the focal length f remains the same because the lens isn't moving; only the object and image distances change. So f is constant.

So, initially, 1/f = 1/do_initial + 1/di_initial.

After moving the screen, 1/f = 1/do_final + 1/di_final.

Since f is the same in both cases, we can set these equal:

1/do_initial + 1/di_initial = 1/do_final + 1/di_final.

We can plug in the known values.

We have:

do_initial = 19.2 inches.

di_initial = 1920 inches.

di_final = 1920 - 100 = 1820 inches.

So,

1/19.2 + 1/1920 = 1/do_final + 1/1820.

Let me calculate each term.

First, 1/19.2 is approximately 0.0520833.

1/1920 is approximately 0.000520833.

So the sum is about 0.0520833 + 0.000520833 = 0.052604166.

Now, for the final side:

1/do_final + 1/1820 = ?

We can plug in 1/1820 ≈ 0.000549453.

So,

1/do_final ≈ 0.052604166 - 0.000549453 = 0.052054713.

So, do_final ≈ 1 / 0.052054713 ≈ 19.214 inches.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, let me check the calculations again because moving the screen closer would require the object to move towards the lens or away?

Wait, when the screen moves closer, the image distance di decreases. So, to maintain focus, the object distance do must change. Let me think about the lens equation again.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using the magnification formula. Since the screen is moved closer, the image size would change, but the problem isn't asking about the size, just the movement of the object.

Wait, perhaps using the thin lens formula is the way to go.

Let me recompute the initial setup.

Initial:

di_initial = 1920 inches.

m_initial = di_initial / do_initial = 100.

So, do_initial = di_initial / 100 = 1920 / 100 = 19.2 inches.

After moving the screen 100 inches closer: di_final = 1920 - 100 = 1820 inches.

Now, the new magnification m_final = di_final / do_final.

But wait, the magnification can also be expressed as m = (di) / (do), but since the slide's position changes, we can find the new do_final.

But wait, the problem is about how much the slide must move relative to the lens. So, the change in do is delta_do = do_final - do_initial.

So, let's compute do_final.

Using the lens formula: 1/f = 1/do_initial + 1/di_initial.

Then, 1/f = 1/do_final + 1/di_final.

So,

1/do_final = 1/f - 1/di_final.

But 1/f = 1/do_initial + 1/di_initial.

So,

1/do_final = (1/do_initial + 1/di_initial) - 1/di_final.

So,

1/do_final = (1/19.2 + 1/1920) - 1/1820.

Let me compute each part.

1/19.2 = 0.052083333.

1/1920 ≈ 0.000520833.

So their sum is 0.052083333 + 0.000520833 = 0.052604166.

Then, 1/1820 ≈ 0.000549453.

So,

1/do_final = 0.052604166 - 0.000549453 = 0.052054713.

So,

do_final = 1 / 0.052054713 ≈ 19.214 inches.

Wait, that can't be correct because that would mean the object moved from 19.2 to about 19.214 inches, which is a tiny movement. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in subtraction.

Wait, 0.052604166 minus 0.000549453 is 0.052054713.

So, 1/19.214 ≈ 0.052054713.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the change in do is do_final - do_initial = 19.214 - 19.2 = 0.014 inches.

Wait, but that's approximately 0.014 inches, which is about 0.01 inches. Looking at the options, option A is 0.01 inches.

But wait, let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach is to use the relationship between the object and image distances.

We know that 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

So, initially, 1/f = 1/19.2 + 1/1920.

After moving, 1/f = 1/do_final + 1/1820.

Subtracting the two equations:

[1/19.2 + 1/1920] - [1/do_final + 1/1820] = 0.

So,

1/19.2 + 1/1920 = 1/do_final + 1/1820.

Rearranged as before.

So, 1/do_final = 1/19.2 + 1/1920 - 1/1820.

Let me compute each term more accurately.

Compute 1/19.2:

19.2 = 192/10, so 1/19.2 = 10/192 = 5/96 ≈ 0.052083333.

1/1920 = 1/(192*10) = 1/1920 ≈ 0.000520833.

So, sum of these two: 0.052083333 + 0.000520833 = 0.052604166.

Now, 1/1820 ≈ 0.000549453.

So, 0.052604166 - 0.000549453 = 0.052054713.

Thus, 1/do_final = 0.052054713 → do_final ≈ 19.214 inches.

Change in do: 19.214 - 19.2 = 0.014 inches. So approximately 0.014 inches.

Looking at the options, the closest is A: 0.01 inches.

Wait, but 0.014 is closer to 0.01 than to 0.02, so the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/do_final.

Wait, 0.052054713 is 1/do_final. So, do_final = 1 / 0.052054713.

Let me compute that more accurately.

0.052054713 → invert it.

Let me compute 1/0.052054713.

I can approximate this as follows:

0.052054713 ≈ 0.052055.

Let me compute 1 / 0.052055.

Since 1/0.05 is 20, but 0.052055 is a bit higher, so 1/0.052055 is a bit less than 20.

Let me compute:

0.052055 * 19.2 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 1 / 0.052054713.

Using a calculator approach:

Approximating:

0.052054713 ≈ 0.052055.

So, 1/0.052055 = approximately 19.2143 inches.

So, yes, do_final ≈ 19.2143 inches.

So the change in do is 0.0143 inches, which is about 0.014 inches.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.01 inches, which is the closest.

So the answer should be A: 0.01 inches.

To solve the problem, we use the lens formula and the magnification relationship. Initially, the image is 100 times larger, so the magnification \( m = 100 = \frac{d_i}{d_o} \). The screen is initially 160 ft (1920 inches) away, so \( d_i = 1920 \, \text{inches} \). Using the magnification formula, \( d_o = \frac{d_i}{m} = \frac{1920}{100} = 19.2 \, \text{inches} \).

When the screen moves 100 inches closer, the new image distance is \( d_i' = 1920 - 100 = 1820 \, \text{inches} \). Using the lens formula \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} \), we calculate the new object distance \( d_o' \). The focal length \( f \) remains constant, so:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{19.2} + \frac{1}{1920}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o'} + \frac{1}{1820}
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( \frac{1}{f} \):

\[
\frac{1}{19.2} + \frac{1}{1920} = \frac{1}{d_o'} + \frac{1}{1820}
\]

After calculations, we find \( d_o' \approx 19.214 \, \text{inches} \). The change in the object distance is:

\[
\Delta d_o = d_o' - d_o = 19.214 - 19.2 = 0.014 \, \text{inches}
\]

Rounding to the nearest option, the lantern slide must move approximately **0.01 inches** closer to the lens.
