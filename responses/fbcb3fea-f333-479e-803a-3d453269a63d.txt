Question:

The secondarily altricial condition of modern human babies may have been an evolutionary solution, in that:

Options:

A: it resulted in babies being born with fully formed teeth.
B: it allowed for subsequent growth of the brain, since bipedalism had resulted in a narrowed birth canal in the female pelvis.
C: it led to an increase in the size of the newborn's head, allowing for a larger brain.
D: the brain size of hominids had not grown for more than a million years, making it difficult for babies to walk.
E: it allowed babies to be born with an instinctive ability to swim.
F: it allowed for an earlier development of language skills in babies.
G: it allowed for bipedalism and independence from the mother at an earlier age.
H: it allowed for growth of the brain to nearly adult size prior to birth, since bipedalism had resulted in a wider birth canal in the female pelvis.
I: it allowed for the development of advanced motor skills at an earlier age.
J: it led to an increase in the gestation period allowing for the brain to fully develop before birth.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the evolution of human babies being altricial. I'm a bit rusty on some of the terms here, but I'll try to break it down.

First, the question is about why modern human babies are secondarily altricial. I remember that altricial means that the young are born in an undeveloped state and require care from parents. Primarily altricial animals are born in that condition because they're not developed enough to survive on their own, like many mammals. Secondary altricial, I think, refers to animals that are born more developed but still need some parental care, but maybe they're more developed than when they're born. Wait, no, actually, I think secondary altricial might mean that they were once born more developed (like in a previous state) but evolved to be born less developed. So, in this case, humans might have evolved to be more altricial compared to our ancestors.

The question is asking why this secondary altricial condition evolved. The options are from A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Resulted in babies being born with fully formed teeth. I don't think that's right. Modern babies are born without teeth, and they develop them later. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Allowed for subsequent growth of the brain because bipedalism narrowed the birth canal. Hmm, this makes sense. Bipedalism, walking on two legs, led to changes in the pelvis, making the birth canal narrower. So the baby's head had to be smaller at birth to pass through, but the baby's brain continues to grow after birth. So humans are born with a smaller brain relative to adults, allowing it to grow more after birth. That seems plausible.

Option C: Led to an increase in the newborn's head size, allowing for a larger brain. Wait, if the birth canal is narrower, the head can't be too big. So maybe the head doesn't get bigger at birth, but the brain grows after. So C might not be correct because it's the oppositeâ€”birth canal constraints probably limit head size at birth, but the brain grows later.

Option D: Brain size hadn't grown for a million years, making it hard for babies to walk. I don't remember anything about a million-year stagnation in brain size. Plus, the link to walking seems unclear. Maybe not D.

Option E: Allowed babies to be born with an instinctive ability to swim. I don't think human babies are particularly known for swimming at birth. They can hold their breath, but instinctive swimming? Not sure, but I don't think that's a key evolutionary reason.

Option F: Allowed for earlier language skills. Language development is more about the brain's growth and learning after birth, not necessarily tied to being altricial. So F might not be the reason.

Option G: Allowed bipedalism and independence earlier. Bipedalism is already the cause of the narrower pelvis. Independence at an earlier age might relate, but I'm not sure how that ties to being altricial. Maybe not the main reason.

Option H: Allowed brain growth to near adult size before birth because of a wider pelvis. Wait, bipedalism caused the pelvis to narrow, not widen. So H is probably incorrect because it's the opposite of what happened.

Option I: Allowed advanced motor skills earlier. Again, motor skills develop after birth, especially in humans, so maybe not directly tied to being altricial.

Option J: Led to longer gestation to allow brain to fully develop. But humans actually have a shorter gestation period compared to some other primates, and the brain continues to develop after birth. So J might not be correct.

So, going back to option B. The key points are that bipedalism led to a narrower pelvis and birth canal, making it difficult for a baby with a large head to pass through. Therefore, the baby is born with a smaller head but a developed brain stem, allowing the brain to grow after birth. This is the secondary altricial condition because, while the baby is not as developed as in some other species, it can survive due to parental care, and the brain grows during infancy.

So the correct answer is B.

The secondarily altricial condition of modern human babies evolved due to the narrowing of the female pelvis as a result of bipedalism. This adaptation allowed for the survival of babies born with smaller heads, enabling their brains to grow significantly after birth. 

Answer: B
