Question:

A homeowner was injured when an automatic cutoff switch failed to function on a snowblower he was using. The cutoff switch had functioned well for a year after he purchased the snowblower but failed after the machine had been improperly repaired by a mechanic. The snowblower's operating manual contained a clear and prominent warning against making the very alteration to the switch mechanism that was made by the mechanic. The mechanic, however, did not have a manual available when he repaired the snowblower. Does the homeowner have a viable claim against the manufacturer of the snowblower for damages?

Options:

A: Yes, because the manufacturer should have made the manual available to repair personnel.
B: Yes, because the snowblower should have had a backup safety system in place.
C: No, because the injury resulted from a substantial alteration of the snowblower by a third party. a third party.
D: No, because the mechanic is solely responsible for the improper repair.
E: No, because the homeowner was contributorily negligent in failing to furnish the snowblower's manual to the mechanic.
F: No, because the homeowner should have ensured the mechanic had access to the correct manual.
G: Yes, because a defect in the snowblower caused the homeowner's injury.
H: Yes, because the cutoff switch should not have failed regardless of the repair.
I: Yes, because the manufacturer should have made the switch mechanism more robust.
J: No, because the homeowner should have requested a professional repair from the manufacturer.

Alright, let's try to figure out this question. So, the scenario is about a homeowner who got injured because an automatic cutoff switch on his snowblower failed. The switch had been working fine for a year after he bought it, but then it failed after a mechanic made an improper repair. The manual clearly warned against the alteration the mechanic made, but the mechanic didn't have the manual when he did the repair. The question is whether the homeowner can claim damages against the manufacturer.

Okay, first, let me break down the facts. The snowblower had a manual that warned against a specific alteration. The mechanic did that alteration without the manual, which probably means he didn't know about the warning. The switch failed because of this alteration, leading to the injury.

Now, the main issue here is product liability. Typically, manufacturers can be held liable if their product has a defect that causes injury. But there are defenses, like misuse of the product or contributory negligence.

So, the manufacturer's manual had a clear warning. The mechanic ignored that warning because he didn't have the manual. But wait, the homeowner is suing the manufacturer, not the mechanic. So, does the manufacturer's liability depend on whether the product was used as intended?

I think about the concept of misuse. If the product was misused in a way that the manufacturer couldn't have foreseen, the manufacturer might not be liable. Here, the mechanic made an alteration that the manual warned against. That seems like misuse.

Also, the homeowner provided the manual, but the mechanic didn't have it. So, the homeowner isn't at fault for the mechanic not having it. But the mechanic's actions might be considered a misuse of the product.

Another point is whether the manufacturer is responsible for how third parties (like mechanics) use their product. Manufacturers usually aren't liable for misuse by third parties, especially when there are clear warnings.

Looking at the options:

Option C says no because the injury was due to a substantial alteration by a third party. That sounds plausible because the mechanic altered the switch, which the manual warned against.

Option E says no because the homeowner was contributorily negligent in not giving the manual to the mechanic. But the homeowner did provide the manual; the mechanic didn't have it during repair. So maybe E isn't correct.

Option D says no because the mechanic is solely responsible. But the question is about the manufacturer's liability, not the mechanic's.

Option C seems to fit because the injury resulted from a third party's alteration, which the manufacturer warned against. So the manufacturer might not be liable because the product wasn't used as intended.

Wait, but the manual was clear, so the manufacturer did warn. The mechanic's action was contrary to that warning. So, the manufacturer isn't at fault because they provided adequate warnings, and the misuse was by someone else.

So, the answer should be C: No, because the injury resulted from a substantial alteration by a third party.

The injury occurred because the mechanic made an alteration that was explicitly warned against in the manual. The manufacturer provided clear warnings, and the misuse of the product by the third party (the mechanic) likely absolves the manufacturer of liability. 

Answer: C
