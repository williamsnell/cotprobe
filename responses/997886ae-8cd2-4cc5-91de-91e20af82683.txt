Okay, so I have this economics question in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about a measure of a firm's monopoly pricing or market power. The key here is that the larger the value of the index, the greater the firm's market pricing power. So I'm looking for an option that represents that.

First, I remember that in economics, when a firm has market power, it can set prices above marginal cost (MC). In a perfectly competitive market, P equals MC, so any deviation from that indicates some degree of market power. So the measure should involve the difference between P and MC.

I think the Lerner Index is what they're referring to here. The Lerner Index is a measure of a firm's market power. It's calculated as (P - MC)/P. Wait, but I might be mixing up the formula. Let me recall: the Lerner Index is the difference between price and marginal cost divided by the price. So it's (P - MC)/P. That makes sense because if P is much larger than MC, the index is higher, indicating more market power.

Looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: (P-MC)/MC². Hmm, that's (P-MC) divided by MC squared. Doesn't look familiar. Not sure about this one.

Option B: (P-MC²)/P. Wait, that's P minus MC squared, then divided by P. That seems odd because MC squared might not make sense in this context. Plus, the numerator would be very large if MC is greater than 1, which might not be the case. Also, the Lerner Index isn't squared like that.

Option C: (MC-P)/MC. That's negative because MC is usually less than P. So this would give a negative value, which doesn't make sense as an index for market power. We want a positive measure where a higher value indicates more power.

Option D: (MC-P)/MC². Again, negative and squared, which seems unlikely. Plus, it's (MC-P), so that would be negative.

Option E: (MC-P)/P². Same issue as above, negative and squared denominator. Doesn't fit.

Option F: (P² - MC)/P. That would be P squared minus MC over P. Which simplifies to P - (MC/P). Doesn't ring a bell. The Lerner Index is (P-MC)/P, not P squared.

Option G: (MC-P)/P. That's (MC - P)/P, which is -(P-MC)/P. So it's the negative of the Lerner Index. But the index itself isn't negative; it's the absolute value that matters. However, the question says the larger the value, the more market power. So if it's negative, a larger (more negative) number would imply more market power? That doesn't make sense because the Lerner Index is positive. So probably not G.

Option H: (P-MC)/MC. So that's (P - MC) over MC. That's different from the Lerner Index. The Lerner Index is (P-MC)/P, not MC. So this would give a different measure, perhaps indicating how much higher P is relative to MC, but not in terms of P itself. Not sure if this is the standard measure.

Option I: (MC² - P)/MC. That seems off because MC squared minus P over MC. Again, not matching the Lerner Index formula.

Option J: (P-MC)/P. Oh, wait, that's exactly (P-MC)/P, which is the Lerner Index. So J would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought the Lerner Index is (P - MC)/P. Yes, that's correct. So option J matches that. Let me check the options again to make sure.

Looking back, option J is (P-MC)/P, which is exactly the Lerner Index. So the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is the Lerner Index, which is calculated as (P - MC)/P. This measure indicates a firm's market power, with a higher value reflecting greater pricing power. Among the options provided, only option J matches this formula.

Answer: J
