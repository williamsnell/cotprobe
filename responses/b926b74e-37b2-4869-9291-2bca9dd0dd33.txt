Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about voting laws and what must be true if the law is upheld by the court. I'm a bit rusty on my constitutional law, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the standard the court uses to review the law. I remember there are different levels of scrutiny applied by courts when evaluating laws that may infringe on constitutional rights. The level of scrutiny depends on the nature of the right being affected and the type of law in question.

Voting rights are a fundamental right, so I think this falls under strict scrutiny. Strict scrutiny is the highest level of judicial review. The Supreme Court typically applies strict scrutiny when a law infringes on a fundamental right, such as freedom of speech, equal protection, or, in this case, the right to vote.

Under strict scrutiny, the government must show that the law in question is necessary to achieve a compelling governmental interest. "Necessary" here doesn't just mean helpful or useful; it means that the law must be the least restrictive means to achieve that interest. So the law must not only serve a compelling purpose but also be narrowly tailored to do so without unnecessarily infringing on the right.

Looking at the options:

A: The law is necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose. This seems to align with strict scrutiny because it mentions both necessity and a compelling purpose. But wait, isn't it more precise to say that the law must be "substantially related" to a compelling purpose? Or does "necessary" cover that?

B: The law is substantially related to an important government purpose. Hmm, "substantially related" sounds a bit like the intermediate scrutiny standard, which applies to laws that burden a protected right but aren't fundamental. Intermediate scrutiny requires the law to be substantially related to an important government interest. But if this is a strict scrutiny case, then this might not be the right answer.

C: The law is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. That's rational basis review, the lowest level. It's used when the right isn't fundamental. So if this is about voting, which is a fundamental right, this can't be the correct standard.

D: The law is substantially related to a legitimate government purpose. Wait, no, because "substantially related" is again more about intermediate scrutiny. Plus, "legitimate" is a lower bar than "compelling." So D doesn't fit strict scrutiny.

So, going back, under strict scrutiny, the government must prove that the law is necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose. So option A seems to fit because it mentions both necessity and a compelling purpose.

But wait, sometimes I get confused between "substantially related" and "necessary." Let me clarify. Strict scrutiny requires the law to be necessary, which is a higher standard than "substantially related." So if a law is "substantially related," that's for intermediate scrutiny, but "necessary" is for strict.

So the correct standard for upholding a law under strict scrutiny is that it must be necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose. Therefore, option A is correct.

The correct answer is A: The law is necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose. Under strict scrutiny, which applies to laws infringing on fundamental rights like voting, the government must demonstrate that the law is necessary to achieve a compelling purpose, using the least restrictive means. 

Answer: A
