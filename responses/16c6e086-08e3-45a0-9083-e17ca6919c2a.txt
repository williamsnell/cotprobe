Okay, so I've got this problem here about boiling points. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on colligative properties, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says that ethanol boils at 78.5°C. Then, 10 grams of sucrose (C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁) is dissolved in 150 grams of ethanol. We need to find the boiling point of the solution. Oh, and the k_b is given as 1.20°C per molal for the alcohol. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that boiling point elevation is a colligative property, which depends on the number of solute particles. The formula for the boiling point elevation is ΔT = k_b * m, where m is the molality of the solute. Then, the new boiling point is T_b = T_b^° + ΔT.

So, I need to find the molality of the sucrose solution. Molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. Here, the solute is sucrose, and the solvent is ethanol.

Let me calculate the moles of sucrose. The molar mass of sucrose is (12*12) + (1*22) + (16*11) = let's see, 12*12 is 144, 1*22 is 22, and 16*11 is 176. Adding them up: 144 +22=166 +176=342 g/mol. So, 10 grams of sucrose divided by 342 g/mol equals approximately 0.0292 moles.

Wait, let me double-check that math. 342 times 0.0292 is about 10. So yeah, 10/342 ≈ 0.02924 moles.

The solvent is ethanol, and we have 150 grams of it. The molar mass of ethanol (C₂H₅OH) is (12*2) + (1*6) + (16*1) + (1*1) = 24 +6 +16 +1 = 47 g/mol. So, 150 g divided by 47 g/mol is about 3.1915 kilograms? Wait, no, 150 grams is 0.150 kg. Wait, no, wait. Wait, molality is moles per kg of solvent. So, the solvent mass is 150 grams, which is 0.150 kg.

Wait no, wait. Wait, 150 grams is 0.150 kg? No, no, wait. 1 kg is 1000 grams, so 150 grams is 0.150 kg. So, the molality m is moles of solute divided by kg of solvent. So, m = 0.02924 moles / 0.150 kg = approx 0.1949 mol/kg.

Wait, let me do that calculation more accurately. 0.02924 / 0.150. Let's see, 0.02924 ÷ 0.15. Hmm, 0.15 times 0.1949 is about 0.029235, so yeah, so m ≈ 0.1949 mol/kg.

Now, the k_b is given as 1.20°C/mol. So, ΔT = k_b * m = 1.20 * 0.1949 ≈ 0.2339°C.

So, the boiling point of the solution is the original boiling point of ethanol plus this elevation. So, 78.5 + 0.2339 ≈ 78.7339°C.

Looking at the options, option C is 78.73°C, E is 78.9, F is 78.65, G is 78.85, etc. So 78.73 is option C.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't mix up the solvent and solute. Oh wait, wait, in boiling point elevation, the solvent is the component that's boiling, which is ethanol here. So the solute is the sugar, which is dissolved in ethanol. So yes, the molality is correct.

Hmm, did I compute the moles right? Sucrose is 10g. Molar mass: 12*12 is 144, 1*22 is 22, 16*11 is 176. 144+22=166 +176=342. 10/342 is approximately 0.02924 moles. So yes.

And 150 grams of ethanol is 0.150 kg. So, m = 0.02924 / 0.150 = 0.1949 mol/kg. Then, 1.20 * 0.1949 = 0.23388°C. So 78.5 + 0.23388 is 78.73388, which rounds to 78.73°C. So option C is correct.

To determine the boiling point of the solution, we use the formula for boiling point elevation:  
\[
\Delta T = k_b \cdot m
\]  
where \( k_b = 1.20 \, \text{°C/molal} \) and \( m \) is the molality of the solute.  

1. **Calculate the moles of sucrose (solute):**  
   The molar mass of sucrose (\( C_{12}H_{22}O_{11} \)) is \( 342 \, \text{g/mol} \).  
   \[
   \text{Moles of sucrose} = \frac{10 \, \text{g}}{342 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.02924 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Calculate the molality (\( m \)):**  
   The solvent is ethanol, with a mass of \( 150 \, \text{g} \) (\( 0.150 \, \text{kg} \)).  
   \[
   m = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kg of solvent}} = \frac{0.02924 \, \text{mol}}{0.150 \, \text{kg}} \approx 0.1949 \, \text{mol/kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate the boiling point elevation (\( \Delta T \)):**  
   \[
   \Delta T = k_b \cdot m = 1.20 \, \text{°C/molal} \cdot 0.1949 \, \text{mol/kg} \approx 0.2339 \, \text{°C}
   \]

4. **Calculate the new boiling point:**  
   The boiling point of pure ethanol is \( 78.5 \, \text{°C} \). Adding the elevation:  
   \[
   T_b = 78.5 \, \text{°C} + 0.2339 \, \text{°C} \approx 78.73 \, \text{°C}
   \]

Thus, the boiling point of the solution is approximately \( 78.73 \, \text{°C} \), which corresponds to option **C**.
