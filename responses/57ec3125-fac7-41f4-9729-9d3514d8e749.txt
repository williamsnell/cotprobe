Okay, so I've got this problem here about vapor pressure of a solution. Hmm, I remember that vapor pressure has to do with the tendency of a liquid to evaporate. Oh right, when you mix two liquids, their vapor pressures change based on their mole fractions. 

The problem says that at 303 K, the vapor pressure of benzene is 120 Torr and hexane is 189 Torr. I need to find the vapor pressure of a solution where the mole fraction of benzene is 0.28, assuming ideal behavior. 

Wait, ideal behavior means I can use Raoult's Law, right? Raoult's Law states that the partial vapor pressure of each component is equal to its mole fraction in the solution multiplied by its pure vapor pressure. So the total vapor pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each component.

But wait, the solution has only benzene and hexane, right? So I need to find the mole fraction of each. The mole fraction of benzene is given as 0.28, so the mole fraction of hexane must be 1 minus that. Let me calculate that: 1 - 0.28 = 0.72.

So, using Raoult's Law for each component:

P_benzene = X_benzene * P°_benzene
P_hexane = X_hexane * P°_hexane

Then total vapor pressure P_total = P_benzene + P_hexane.

Plugging in the numbers:

P_benzene = 0.28 * 120 Torr. Let me calculate that: 0.28 * 120 is... 0.28 times 100 is 28, and 0.28 *20 is 5.6, so total 33.6 Torr.

P_hexane = 0.72 * 189 Torr. Hmm, let me compute that. 0.7 * 189 is 132.3, and 0.02 *189 is 3.78. Adding them together gives 132.3 + 3.78 = 136.08 Torr.

Now, adding both partial pressures: 33.6 + 136.08 = 169.68 Torr. Hmm, that's approximately 170 Torr. Looking at the options, option A is 170 Torr. 

Wait, but some options are close. Let me double-check the math. 0.28 *120=33.6, correct. 0.72 *189: 0.7*189=132.3, 0.02*189=3.78. 132.3+3.78=136.08. 33.6+136.08=169.68, which rounds to 170. So option A is correct.

The vapor pressure of the solution is calculated using Raoult's Law, considering the mole fractions and pure vapor pressures of benzene and hexane. The mole fraction of benzene is 0.28, so hexane's mole fraction is 0.72. Applying Raoult's Law, the partial pressures are calculated and summed to give the total vapor pressure of approximately 170 Torr. 

Answer: A
