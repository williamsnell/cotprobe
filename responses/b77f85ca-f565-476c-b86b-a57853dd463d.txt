Okay, so I've got this genetics question about Tay-Sachs disease and equilibrium frequency under mutation and selection. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that Tay-Sachs is a recessive disorder, so only homozygotes show the disease. The question says the frequency in Jewish people is about 0.015, and in non-Jewish it's 0.0015. But the question is about the Jewish population, so I'll focus on that.

The problem states that homozygotes die in infancy or early childhood. So their fitness is zero because they don't survive to reproduce. The selection coefficient is 1, which makes sense because if they don't survive, the fitness is zero, so s=1 for the homozygotes. Wait, no, actually, the selection coefficient (s) is the fitness loss. So if the fitness is 0, then s=1 because 1 - s = 0 implies s=1.

Now, the forward mutation rate is given as 1e-6, which is 1 × 10^-6. I think this is the mutation rate from the normal allele to the recessive disease allele, right? So mu (μ) is 1e-6. But wait, mutation can also go the other way, but I think in this scenario, we're considering only the forward mutation because the question is about the equilibrium and the mutation rate provided is likely the only one affecting the allele frequency.

In equilibrium under mutation-selection balance, the frequency of the recessive allele (let's call it q) should be such that the rate of mutation into q equals the rate of selection removing q. For a recessive disease, the equilibrium frequency is usually given by q ≈ sqrt(μ/(s)), but wait, because for a recessive allele, the heterozygote is not affected, so selection acts only on the homozygotes.

Wait, no, I think the formula for mutation-selection balance when selection acts on the recessive homozygote is q = sqrt(μ/(h s)), but here h is the dominance coefficient. Since it's a recessive disease, the heterozygote has the same fitness as the wild type, so h=0. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

When the allele is completely recessive, the heterozygote has fitness 1, and only the homozygote has fitness 1 - s. So the selection against the homozygote is s=1, as stated.

The standard formula for mutation-selection balance for a recessive allele is q ≈ sqrt(μ/(s)). Wait, but wait, another approach is to model the allele frequency change.

The change in q due to selection can be approximated, considering only the homozygotes. Let me recall the formula.

In a population, the frequency of the recessive allele q is such that the loss due to selection is balanced by the gain from mutation.

The equilibrium condition is that the input from mutation equals the loss from selection.

The mutation adds μ per generation, but since each allele can mutate, the mutation rate adds μ to q each generation. But wait, considering that each individual has two alleles, but mutation rates are per allele, so the total mutation rate per diploid is 2μ, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no, the mutation rate given is per allele. So each allele has a chance μ of mutating. So the mutation rate from A to a is μ, and a to A is possibly different, but here we're only given μ as the forward rate. But I think for this problem, we can ignore the backward mutation because it's much smaller or not considered, so we can approximate the equilibrium by the mutation rate in.

But let's think in terms of the model.

At equilibrium, the change in q (Δq) is zero. The change due to mutation is μ*(1 - q) because each normal allele (frequency 1 - q) can mutate to a with rate μ. So the mutation adds μ*(1 - q) to q.

The change due to selection is a bit more involved. The fitness of each genotype would be:

- AA: fitness 1
- Aa: fitness 1 (since recessive)
- aa: fitness 0 (since selection coefficient s=1)

The average fitness W_bar is the sum of each genotype's frequency multiplied by their fitness.

So W_bar = (p^2)(1) + (2pq)(1) + (q^2)(0) = p^2 + 2pq.

But p = 1 - q, so W_bar = (1 - q)^2 + 2(1 - q) q = 1 - 2q + q^2 + 2q - 2q^2 = 1 - q^2.

Wait, no, let me compute that correctly.

p = 1 - q.

p^2 = (1 - q)^2 = 1 - 2q + q^2.

2pq = 2(1 - q) q = 2q - 2q^2.

q^2 * 0 = 0.

So W_bar = (1 - 2q + q^2) + (2q - 2q^2) = 1 - 2q + q^2 + 2q - 2q^2 = 1 - q^2.

Wait, that can't be right because when q is 0, W_bar should be 1. Let me check again.

Wait, (1 - q)^2 is 1 - 2q + q^2.

2pq is 2(1 - q)q = 2q - 2q^2.

So adding together: 1 - 2q + q^2 + 2q - 2q^2 = 1 + ( -2q + 2q ) + ( q^2 - 2q^2 ) = 1 - q^2.

That seems correct.

Now, the allele frequency after selection can be found by calculating the frequency of a alleles in the next generation.

The proportion of a alleles is [2pq * 1 + q^2 * 0] / (2 W_bar).

Wait, no. The a alleles come from Aa and aa individuals.

Each Aa contributes one a allele, but each aa contributes two a alleles, but their fitness is zero, so they don't contribute. So the a alleles come from the Aa individuals.

So the total a alleles after selection is (2pq * (1)) * 1 (since their fitness is 1), and the total alleles is 2 W_bar, which is 2(1 - q^2).

So the new q after selection would be [2pq * 1] / [2(1 - q^2)] = [2(1 - q) q ] / [2 (1 - q^2)].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2 q (1 - q)

Denominator: 2 (1 - q)(1 + q)

Cancel 2 and (1 - q):

q / (1 + q).

Wait, but that's only considering selection. But we also have mutation adding new a alleles.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to model the change in q as the balance between mutation and selection.

The equilibrium condition is mutation rate equals selection pressure.

In the case of a recessive allele, the equilibrium q is given by sqrt(μ / s), because the selection against the homozygous is s, and the mutation rate is μ.

Wait, but let's think about it more carefully. The selection removes the a alleles because the aa individuals don't survive, but the mutation adds a alleles.

So the rate at which a alleles are lost due to selection is proportional to q^2 (the frequency of aa individuals) times s (which is 1 here). But each aa individual would have two a alleles, so the number of a alleles lost is 2 q^2 * s * N, where N is the population size. But perhaps it's better to model it per allele.

Alternatively, the rate of loss of a alleles due to selection is q^2 * s (because each aa individual dies, so each a allele in aa is lost). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the loss of a alleles due to selection is q^2 * s, because each aa individual contributes zero to the next generation, so the a alleles are lost at a rate of q^2 * s.

The gain of a alleles due to mutation is μ (1 - q), because each normal allele (frequency 1 - q) can mutate to a with rate μ.

At equilibrium, the gain equals the loss:

μ (1 - q) ≈ q^2 s.

Because when q is small, (1 - q) ≈ 1, so we can approximate:

μ ≈ q^2 s.

Solving for q:

q ≈ sqrt(μ / s).

Given that μ is 1e-6, and s=1, so q ≈ sqrt(1e-6 / 1) = sqrt(1e-6) = 1e-3.

Wait, that's 0.001. But looking at the options, option B is 0.001, option J is 0.015, which is the current frequency given in the problem. But the question is about the equilibrium, so the current frequency may not be the equilibrium.

Wait, but wait, in the question, the current frequency is 0.015, but under mutation-selection balance, the equilibrium would be around 0.001. So the answer should be 0.001, option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. The formula for equilibrium when selection acts on recessive homozygotes is q ≈ sqrt(μ / s). So with μ=1e-6 and s=1, q ≈ 1e-3, which is 0.001. So the answer is B.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing any factors. Sometimes, when considering mutation both ways (forward and backward), the formula gets more complicated, but the question only gives the forward mutation rate, so perhaps we can ignore the backward mutation. So the formula holds.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: the equilibrium frequency for a recessive allele under mutation-selection balance is q ≈ sqrt(μ/s), which in this case is sqrt(1e-6 /1) = 0.001. So the answer is B.

The question involves determining the equilibrium frequency of the Tay-Sachs gene in the Jewish population under mutation-selection balance. Tay-Sachs is a recessive disorder, meaning only homozygotes (aa) are affected, and their fitness is zero due to the selection coefficient \( s = 1 \). The forward mutation rate from the normal allele (A) to the disease allele (a) is \( \mu = 1 \times 10^{-6} \).

At equilibrium, the rate of mutation introducing the disease allele equals the rate of selection removing it. For a recessive allele, the equilibrium frequency \( q \) is given by:

\[
q \approx \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{s}}
\]

Substituting the given values \( \mu = 1 \times 10^{-6} \) and \( s = 1 \):

\[
q \approx \sqrt{\frac{1 \times 10^{-6}}{1}} = \sqrt{1 \times 10^{-6}} = 1 \times 10^{-3} = 0.001
\]

This matches option B. The current frequency of 0.015 in the Jewish population is not the equilibrium frequency under mutation-selection balance, as the equilibrium is determined by the balance between mutation and selection.
