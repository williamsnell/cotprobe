Question:

A woman inherited her father's farm when he died testate. Prior to her father's death, the woman had already taken over the operations on the father's farm due to his declining health. Recently, the woman had granted a coal company rights to strip-mine coal from underneath the farm. Their agreement stipulated that the coal company would pay the woman a per-ton royalty for the coal extracted. In addition, the coal company agreed to fill in the excavated area and replace top soil on the surface of the land. After the coal company commenced its strip-mining operations, the woman noticed that the company was not filling in the excavated area as previously agreed. However, because the company paid the woman all the coal royalties from the strip mining, she did not voice any objection regarding its failure to replace the top soil. Two years later, the coal company had now completed its strip-mining operation under its arrangement with the woman. The coal company's right to strip-mine coal from the woman's property would be an example of a (an)

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a woman who inherited her father's farm after his death, and he died testate, meaning he had a will. Before her father's death, she took over the farm's operations because his health was declining. Then, she granted a coal company the right to strip-mine coal from the farm. The agreement said the company would pay her a royalty per ton of coal and also agreed to fill in the excavated area and replace the topsoil.

But here's the thing: the coal company started mining, and the woman noticed they weren't filling in the area as agreed. However, because the company was paying her all the royalties, she didn't object. Two years later, the coal company finished their operations. Now, the question is about the coal company's right to strip-mine coal from the woman's property. It's asking what kind of right this is, and the options are from A to J.

I need to figure out the legal term that describes the coal company's right here. Let's think about each option.

First, let me recall some property law concepts. I remember that an easement is a non-possessory right to use another's land for a specific purpose. There are different types of easements, like easements appurtenant and in gross. Easements appurtenant benefit another parcel of land, while easements in gross benefit a person or company directly, not tied to land.

A license is usually a personal privilege to use land, revocable at will, but it doesn't create an interest in the land. It's more temporary. A profit-a-prendre is an easement that allows the holder to take resources from the land, like minerals, which seems relevant here because the company is mining coal.

Voluntary waste is when a landowner uses their property in a way that damages it, usually for their own profit but without transferring the damage to others. Constructive trust is more about holding property for another's benefit, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

Looking at the scenario, the coal company has a right to extract coal, which is a mineral resource. They're paying royalties, so it's not a free use. They agreed to refill the area but didn't, but the woman didn't object because of the royalties. The key here is the right to extract minerals, which is a type of profit.

Profit-a-prendre specifically refers to the right to take minerals, timber, or other natural resources from the land. So the coal company's right would be a profit-a-prendre.

Let me check the other options to make sure. An easement appurtenant would require the right to benefit another parcel, which isn't the case here. Easement in gross is possible, but that's more for personal use, not for extracting resources. A license is too temporary and revocable, and the company has a more substantial right here.

So, the correct answer should be H: profit-a-prendre.

The coal company's right to strip-mine coal from the woman's property is best described as a profit-a-prendre, which is a type of easement that allows the extraction of natural resources like minerals.

Answer: H
