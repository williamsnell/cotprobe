Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about types of stress at divergent boundaries. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my plate tectonics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that there are three main types of tectonic plate boundaries: convergent, divergent, and transform. The question is about divergent boundaries, so I need to focus on that.

Divergent boundaries are where two plates are moving away from each other. This usually happens at mid-ocean ridges, right? As the plates pull apart, magma rises up and fills the gap, forming new crust. But what stress type is involved here?

Stress in geology refers to the forces applied to rocks and the Earth's crust. The main types of stress are tensional, compressional, and shear. Tensional stress is like stretching, compressional is squeezing, and shear is sliding past each other.

At divergent boundaries, since the plates are moving apart, the stress should be pulling the crust apart. So that's stretching, which is tensional stress. I think that's right because tensional stress leads to the formation of fractures or rifts. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Compressional stress would be at convergent boundaries where plates collide, like in mountain ranges. Shear stress is more for transform boundaries, like the San Andreas Fault, where there's lateral movement.

So yeah, divergent boundaries are dominated by tensional stress. Looking at the options, E is Tensional.

The stress at divergent boundaries is primarily tensional because the plates are pulling apart, leading to stretching and the formation of fractures or rifts. 

Answer: E
