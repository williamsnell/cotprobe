Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about LSD and why the term "psychomimetic" drug is no longer used. I'm a bit rusty on my pharmacology, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that LSD is a hallucinogenic drug. The term "psychomimetic" was used to describe it because it was thought to mimic the symptoms of certain mental illnesses, like schizophrenia. So, the idea was that LSD caused effects similar to those seen in mental disorders, hence "psychomimetic."

But the question is asking why this explanation has been refuted. So, why don't we call LSD psychomimetic anymore?

Looking at the options:

A: LSD improves mental health. I don't think that's the case. LSD can cause trips that some find enlightening, but overall, it's known for its hallucinogenic effects, not necessarily improving mental health. Also, I think some studies suggest it might have potential for treating certain conditions, but that's not the main point here.

B: Effects of LSD and schizophrenic states are different. This sounds plausible. If the effects are different, then the idea that LSD mimics schizophrenia wouldn't hold. So, maybe they realized that the symptoms aren't the same, hence LSD isn't psychomimetic.

C: Symptoms are identical. That would support the original idea, but the question is why it's been refuted, so if they're identical, C would be wrong. But I think the effects are different.

D: LSD doesn't cause hallucinations. Wait, no, LSD is famous for causing hallucinations. So D is incorrect.

E: Schizophrenia caused by LSD. Actually, I think some studies have suggested that using psychedelics like LSD might trigger schizophrenia in predisposed individuals, but I'm not sure if this is widely accepted. Also, the question is about why the psychomimetic explanation is wrong, not about causation.

F: Effects are same for all. No, LSD effects vary a lot between individuals. So F is incorrect.

G: Affects only visual cortex. No, LSD affects various parts of the brain, including perception, thoughts, etc. So G is wrong.

H: Causes permanent mental illness. That's a possible side effect, but the main point is about mimicking, not causing permanent issues. Also, not all users end up with permanent problems.

I: Effects last only while the drug is in the body. Well, LSD has a relatively long half-life, so effects can last hours, but that's more about duration, not the nature of the effects.

J: Effects only physical, no psychological. No, LSD has strong psychological effects, so J is wrong.

So, going back, the correct answer seems to be B: The effects of LSD and the schizophrenic state are different. Because if their effects are different, then LSD isn't mimicking schizophrenia, so the term psychomimetic isn't accurate anymore. That makes sense.

The term "psychomimetic" was used to describe LSD because it was believed to mimic the symptoms of mental illnesses like schizophrenia. However, this explanation has been refuted because the effects of LSD and schizophrenic states are not the same. LSD causes hallucinations and distortions of perception, while schizophrenia involves a broader range of symptoms, including delusions, disorganized thinking, and negative symptoms, which are not typically caused by LSD. Therefore, the idea that LSD mimics schizophrenia is incorrect.

Answer: B
