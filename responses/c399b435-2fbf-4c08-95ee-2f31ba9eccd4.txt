Okay, so I have this question about a bodhisattva known for guiding the souls of dead children to salvation. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that bodhisattvas are beings in Buddhism who have achieved enlightenment but choose to stay and help others. Each has specific attributes and roles.

Option A is Kannon, also known as Guan Yin in Chinese. I think Kannon is associated with mercy and is often depicted holding a vase of water or a child. I remember hearing that Kannon is sometimes invoked for the protection of children, so maybe this is related.

Option B is Shakyamuni, who is the historical Buddha. He's more about teaching the dharma rather than directly handling the souls of the dead, so probably not him.

Option C is Manjusri, who I think is the bodhisattva of wisdom. He's usually depicted with a sword and riding a lion. His role is more about transcending suffering through wisdom, so maybe not directly related to guiding souls.

Option D is Guan-yin, which is another name for Kannon. So this is the same as option A. So if A is correct, D is also correct, but since they are the same, I think the answer might be A or D. Wait, but the options are separate, so perhaps the answer is listed as one of them. I might need to check that.

Option E is Tara, who is associated with success, protection, and the qualities of a mother. She's also known for helping with specific needs, but I'm not sure if she's specifically linked to children's souls.

Option F is Avalokiteshvara, which is another name for Kannon as well. So again, same as A and D. So if the answer is Kannon, then A, D, and F are all the same, but in the options, they are separate. Hmm, maybe the correct answer is listed under one of these names.

Option G is Vajrapani, who is associated with power and protection, often depicted with a vajra. He's more about overcoming obstacles and protecting the dharma, not specifically about children's souls.

Option H is Ojizo-sama, which I think is a Japanese name for a bodhisattva who protects children and the innocent. I've heard that Ojizo is sometimes associated with the guardianship of children, especially those who have died. He's often depicted with a stone lantern and is venerated in some temples for this purpose.

Option I is Amitabha, the Buddha of infinite light, associated with the Pure Land. He's more about rebirth in the Pure Land and is not specifically linked to guiding souls of children.

Option J is Maitreya, the future Buddha, associated with happiness and the ideal of the future world. Not directly related to the souls of children.

So, putting this together, the question is about which bodhisattva is known for conducting the souls of dead children to salvation. From what I recall, Ojizo-sama is specifically known for this role in Japanese Buddhism. While Kannon/Guan-yin/Avalokiteshvara are associated with mercy and children, Ojizo is more directly linked to protecting and guiding the souls of children, especially after death.

Therefore, the correct answer is likely H: Ojizo-sama.

The correct answer is H: Ojizo-sama, who is known for protecting and guiding the souls of dead children to salvation.
