Okay, so I've got this question about GDP, and I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about GDP.

The question gives me Real GDP as $200 billion and the price index as 200. It's asking for Nominal GDP. Hmm, I remember that GDP can be measured in real terms and nominal terms. Real GDP adjusts for inflation, while nominal GDP doesn't—it's the current price level multiplied by the real output.

Wait, there's a formula for Nominal GDP. I think it's something like Nominal GDP = Real GDP multiplied by the price index divided by 100. Or was it the other way around? Let me think. Oh right, the price index is usually a percentage, like 100 being the base year. So the formula should be Nominal GDP = Real GDP × (Price Index / 100).

So plugging in the numbers: Real GDP is $200 billion, and the price index is 200. So that would be 200 billion multiplied by 200, then divided by 100. Let's calculate that: 200 * 200 = 40,000, then divided by 100 gives 400. So $400 billion.

Looking at the options, I see option I is $400 billion. So that should be the answer. But wait, did I get the formula right? Let me double-check. Real GDP is nominal divided by the price index times 100, right? So rearranged, nominal is real multiplied by price index divided by 100. Yep, that's correct. So I think I is the right choice.

The formula for Nominal GDP is Real GDP multiplied by the price index divided by 100. Using the given values: $200 billion (Real GDP) × (200 / 100) = $400 billion.
