Okay, so I've got this question about heterosexual and gay/lesbian fantasies and who they involve. Let me try to break it down.

The question is asking about the last character of the answer, which is a letter from A to J. The question says that heterosexual fantasies about sexual activity never involve someone _________, and gay and lesbian fantasies never involve persons of __________.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that people's sexual orientations usually determine the gender of the people they are attracted to. So, for example, heterosexual people are attracted to the opposite gender, while gay and lesbian individuals are attracted to the same gender.

Wait, but the question is about what their fantasies do NOT involve. So, if someone is heterosexual, their fantasies would involve the opposite gender, meaning they never involve someone of the same gender. On the flip side, gay and lesbian fantasies involve the same gender, so they never involve someone of the opposite gender.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: of the other gender; of the same gender. So, the first blank would be "other," meaning heterosexuals never involve others of the other gender (which doesn't make sense because they do involve others of the other gender). So A might not be right.

Option B: opposite gender; opposite gender. So both blanks are opposite. That would mean heterosexuals never involve opposite, which can't be right because that's exactly who they do involve. So B is incorrect.

Option C: same gender; same gender. So both blanks are same. That would mean heterosexuals never involve same, which is correct because they do involve opposite. But the second part says gay and lesbian never involve same, which is wrong because they do. So C is incorrect.

Option D: same gender; opposite gender. So first blank is same, meaning hetero never involve same, which is correct. Second blank is opposite, meaning gay and lesbian never involve opposite, which is correct because they focus on same. So D might be the answer.

Option E: other; other. So both blanks are other. That would mean hetero never involve other, which is wrong because they do. So E is out.

Option F: same; opposite. So hetero never involve same, correct. Gay never involve opposite, correct. So F is same as D, but let me check the wording. Wait, the options might have different phrasing.

Option G: Both may involve same or other. That's more about variability, but the question is about what they never involve. So G is about possibilities, not exclusions, so probably not correct.

Option H: Both may involve same only. That's not true because, for example, a heterosexual might have fantasies that involve same gender, but I think the question is about their typical focus. But I'm not sure if this is relevant here.

Option I: Both may involve opposite only. That's not right because homosexuals don't involve opposite. So I is incorrect.

Option J: opposite; same. So hetero never involve opposite (wrong) and gay never involve same (wrong). So J is incorrect.

Wait, I think I messed up earlier. Let me recheck. The question is about what they do NOT involve. So, for heterosexuals, their fantasies never involve someone of the same gender. And for gays and lesbians, their fantasies never involve someone of the opposite gender.

So the first blank should be 'same' and the second blank 'opposite.' Looking at the options, which one matches that?

Option D says "of the same gender; of the opposite gender." So that fits. So the answer should be D.
