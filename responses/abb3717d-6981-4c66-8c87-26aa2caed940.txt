Okay, so I have this question about the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, or WAIS-R. The question is asking about the classic aging pattern, specifically which subtests show decline. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

From what I remember, WAIS-R has both Verbal and Performance subtests. The classic aging pattern refers to how scores typically change with age. I think that as people get older, certain cognitive abilities decline more than others. For example, older adults might have more difficulty with tasks that require speed, memory, and certain types of reasoning.

I recall that the Verbal subtests usually involve more crystallized intelligence, which is knowledge and vocabulary accumulated over time. These might be less affected by aging. On the other hand, Performance subtests often assess fluid intelligence, which includes problem-solving and motor skills that might decline more with age.

So, the classic aging pattern involves decline in Performance subtests. Let me look at the options. Option E says all Performance subtests. Option F is Block Design only, but I think more than just Block Design decline. Option H is Information and Comprehension, which are Verbal, so probably not. Option I is all Verbal, which doesn't fit because Verbal tends to stay more stable.

Wait, no, actually, I think the Verbal subtests might decline a bit, but maybe not as much as Performance. Or is it that Performance subtests are more affected? Let me think. Vocabulary is a Verbal subtest and is often considered to be relatively stable because it's about word knowledge. So if the answer is about decline, maybe the Performance subtests are the ones that decline.

Looking at the options, option E says all Performance subtests. That sounds right because Block Design, Digit Span, Arithmetic, Picture Completion, etc., are Performance. But wait, some of these might have different trends. For example, Arithmetic is a Performance subtest but is more about calculation, which might decline. Digit Span is about memory and attention, which also might decline.

So the classic pattern is that Performance subtests decline, while Verbal might hold up better. Therefore, the correct answer would be E: All Performance subtests.

The classic aging pattern refers to the decline in certain cognitive abilities as people age. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) includes both Verbal and Performance subtests. Verbal subtests, which assess crystallized intelligence (e.g., vocabulary and knowledge), tend to be less affected by aging. In contrast, Performance subtests, which measure fluid intelligence (e.g., problem-solving and motor skills), are more likely to decline with age. 

Among the options provided, the correct answer is that all Performance subtests show a decline. This aligns with the understanding that fluid intelligence, typically assessed in Performance subtests, is more susceptible to age-related changes.
