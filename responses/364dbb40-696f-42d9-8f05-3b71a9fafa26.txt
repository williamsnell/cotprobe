Question:

 In his discussion of discrimination in war, Valls suggests that

Options:

A: the concept of combatants and noncombatants is outdated and irrelevant.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Valls' discussion on discrimination in war. The question is asking what Valls suggests regarding the concepts of combatants and noncombatants. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that in discussions about war ethics, the distinction between combatants and noncombatants is a key point. Combatants are those directly involved in fighting, like soldiers, while noncombatants are civilians not involved in the conflict. The idea is to protect noncombatants as much as possible, which is part of the principle of distinction in international law.

Looking at the options, I need to see which one aligns with what Valls might say. Valls is probably referring to the ethical implications, so maybe he's critiquing the traditional view. Let me go through each option.

Option A says the concept is outdated. I'm not sure if Valls thinks it's outdated or just that the lines are blurred. Option B defines terrorism as violence against noncombatants. That sounds more like a definition rather than Valls' critique of the combatant/noncombatant distinction.

Option C states there's no difference, which seems too absolute. Option D says the difference is largely ambiguous, implying that it's not clear. Option E says the difference is categorical and clear, which is the traditional view. But I think Valls might be arguing against that, suggesting it's not so clear.

Option F defines terrorism as indiscriminate violence. That's another definition, not directly about the combatant/noncombatant distinction. Option G mentions a fine line, which is similar to ambiguity. Option H defines terrorism as excluding war, which again seems like a definition. Option I says the difference is subjective, varying with perspective. Option J says it's a matter of degree, meaning it's not absolute.

I think Valls might argue that the distinction isn't as clear as people think. Maybe he suggests that in modern conflicts, especially with things like terrorism, the lines are blurred. So, the difference is ambiguous or a matter of degree. Looking back, option D says "largely ambiguous" and option J says "a matter of degree." Both seem close. 

Wait, the question is about Valls' discussion. From what I recall, some scholars argue that the distinction is not as clear-cut, perhaps because of asymmetrical warfare or terrorism tactics. So maybe Valls suggests that the difference is ambiguous or that it's a matter of degree. Between D and J, which one is it?

Option D is about ambiguity, while J is about degree. Ambiguous could mean unclear or not well-defined, whereas degree implies a spectrum. I think Valls might lean towards ambiguity rather than a spectrum. So I'm leaning towards D: the difference is largely ambiguous.

But wait, another thought: if the difference is a matter of degree, it means there's a continuum, not just ambiguity. Maybe Valls is saying it's not a clear line but varies, which would be J. Hmm. I'm a bit confused now.

Alternatively, maybe Valls is highlighting that in reality, the lines are often blurred, making the distinction ambiguous. So I think D is more likely the answer.

The question asks what Valls suggests about the distinction between combatants and noncombatants in the context of discrimination in war. Valls likely critiques the traditional view, suggesting that the lines between combatants and noncombatants are not as clear-cut. While options D and J are closely related, D emphasizes ambiguity, which aligns with the idea that the distinction is unclear or not well-defined in modern conflicts. Therefore, the most fitting answer is:

D
