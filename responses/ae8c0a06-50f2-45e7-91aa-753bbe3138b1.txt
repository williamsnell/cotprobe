Okay, so I have this problem where I need to convert a temperature range from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The question says that the extremes of temperature in New York over 50 years differ by 116 Fahrenheit degrees, and I need to express this range in Celsius. The options are given from A to J, each with a specific value.

First, I should recall how to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. The formula I remember is C = (F - 32) * 5/9. But wait, in this case, I'm dealing with a range, not a specific temperature. So I think I need to consider the difference, not the actual temperature values. 

Hmm, okay, so the difference in Fahrenheit is 116 degrees. Since temperature differences are linear across scales, I can convert the difference directly without worrying about the offset (the -32 part). Because when you take the difference between two temperatures, the offset cancels out. So the difference in Celsius would just be the difference in Fahrenheit multiplied by 5/9.

Let me write that down. The formula for the difference would be ΔC = ΔF * (5/9). So plugging in ΔF = 116, I get ΔC = 116 * (5/9). Let me calculate that.

First, 116 multiplied by 5 is 580. Then, 580 divided by 9. Let me do that division. 9 goes into 580 how many times? 9*64=576, so that's 64 times with a remainder of 4. So 580/9 is approximately 64.444... degrees Celsius.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 64.444. Let me check the options again. The options are A:58.7, B:60.0, C:52.3, D:48.9, E:80.0, F:76.4, G:70.2, H:64.5, I:62.0, J:55.6.

Oh, option H is 64.5, which is very close to my calculation of 64.444. So that must be the correct answer. But wait, did I make a mistake in my calculation? Let me double-check.

116 * 5 = 580. 580 divided by 9. Let me compute that more accurately. 9*64=576, so 580-576=4. So it's 64 and 4/9. 4 divided by 9 is approximately 0.444. So 64.444, which rounds to 64.4, but the option is 64.5. That's the closest one, so H is correct.

Wait another thing, maybe I should calculate it more precisely. Let me do the division step by step. 580 ÷ 9.

9 into 58 is 6 (9*6=54), remainder 4. Bring down the 0 to make 40. 9 into 40 is 4 (9*4=36), remainder 4. Bring down the next 0 to make 40 again. So it's 64.444..., recurring. So approximately 64.44°C. The options have H as 64.5, which is the closest whole number. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to round to one decimal place, but looking at the options, some are in whole numbers, others in one decimal. H is 64.5, which is exactly one decimal place. So that's the correct choice.

The temperature range in Fahrenheit is 116°F. To convert this range to Celsius, we use the formula for temperature differences: ΔC = ΔF × (5/9). Calculating 116 × 5/9 gives approximately 64.44°C, which rounds to 64.5°C. The closest option is H.

Answer: H
