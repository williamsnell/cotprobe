Question:

A year ago, a very wealthy man died in a car accident. A woman, whose mother worked as a secretary to the wealthy man for years, filed a claim against the estate, alleging that she was the wealthy man's daughter. At trial, the woman's attorney called the wealthy man's butler to testify. The butler testified that it was Common knowledge in the household that the wealthy man and the woman's mother were having an affair. The butler also testified that the wealthy man had often confided in him and told him shortly after the woman's birth that the woman was the wealthy man's daughter. Upon objection by the attorney for the executor of the wealthy man's estate, the court will most likely

Options:

A: sustain the objection because the butler's testimony is considered privileged communication and is therefore inadmissible.
B: overrule the objection because the butler's testimony would be relevant to the ultimate issue in the case.
C: sustain the objection because the butler's testimony would be considered gossip and not admissible in court.
D: sustain the objection bc butler's testimony would be violative of hearsay rule.
E: overrule the objection because the butler's testimony is considered a statement against interest and is therefore admissible.
F: overrule the objection because the butler's testimony qualifies under the exception to the hearsay rule for statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment.
G: sustain the objection because the butler's testimony would be in violation of attorney-client privilege.
H: overrule the objection because the butler's testimony would be admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under the dying declaration doctrine.
I: overrule objection because the butler's testimony would qualify under the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.
J: sustain, bc butler's testimony would be violative of Dead man's statute.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about evidence admissibility. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a woman is claiming she's the daughter of a deceased wealthy man. To prove this, her attorney called the man's butler as a witness. The butler testified two main things: first, that it was common knowledge in the household that the man and the woman's mother were having an affair, and second, that the man told him shortly after the woman's birth that she was his daughter.

The opposing attorney objected, and now the court has to decide whether to sustain or overrule that objection.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which rule applies here. The key issue seems to be whether the butler's testimony is admissible or not, likely due to hearsay rules.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If the butler is testifying about what the man told him, that's hearsay unless an exception applies.

First, the butler's statement about the affair being common knowledge—probably not hearsay because it's not being offered for the truth of the affair, but maybe as part of the household's belief. But the main issue is the second part: the man telling the butler that the woman is his daughter.

So, that's a statement the man made to the butler. If it's offered to prove that the woman is his daughter, it's hearsay. Now, are there any exceptions?

Looking at the options:

A: Privileged communication. I don't think butler-employer communication is privileged. Usually, privilege applies to things like attorney-client, doctor-patient, etc. So probably not A.

B: Relevance to the ultimate issue. While relevance is important, the objection here is about admissibility, not just relevance. So the court might overrule if it's relevant, but it's more about hearsay.

C: Gossip. Common knowledge might be considered gossip, but the main issue is the statement about the daughter, which is hearsay. So C might not be the main reason.

D: Hearsay rule violation. If no exception applies, the court would sustain the objection because it's hearsay. But let's check other options.

E: Statement against interest. A statement against interest is when the declarant's statement goes against their own interest. Here, the man saying the woman is his daughter—does that harm him? It might be self-inculpatory if, say, he's acknowledging paternity, but in this case, he's deceased, so it's not clear. Also, for a statement against interest, the declarant must be unavailable, which he is, but I'm not sure if this fits. It's more about statements like admitting guilt or something that would subject the declarant to liability.

F: Medical diagnosis/treatment. No, the statement doesn't relate to medical matters. So F is out.

G: Attorney-client privilege. The butler isn't a lawyer, so no. G is incorrect.

H: Dying declaration. That requires the declarant to believe their death is imminent. The question doesn't mention that the man knew he was dying when he made the statement. So H is probably not applicable.

I: Pedigree exception. I'm not too familiar, but I think the pedigree exception is for statements about genealogy or parentage made in certain circumstances. Wait, this might fit. The statement is about parentage, made by the father to the butler. Pedigree exception allows statements about family history, especially when made by a person with knowledge. So I could be a possibility.

J: Dead man's statute. That typically prohibits using statements against a deceased party to prove the contents of a will or similar, but here the issue is about parentage, not a will. So J might not apply.

So, the key is whether the statement falls under an exception to hearsay. The butler's testimony about the man's statement is hearsay unless an exception applies.

Option I mentions the pedigree exception. I think that exception allows statements about family matters, especially those related to parentage, if they were made by someone with knowledge and under certain circumstances. So the butler's testimony about the man's statement could qualify under the pedigree exception, making the statement admissible. Therefore, the court would overrule the objection, meaning the correct answer would be I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I'm not 100% sure about the pedigree exception. Another angle: the statement was made to the butler, who is a household member. Maybe it's an admission by a party-opponent? Because the man is the opposing party (the estate), so statements made by him would be admissions and thus exceptions to hearsay. But the options don't mention that. Alternatively, the statement might be considered a declaration against interest if it's self-inculpatory, but that seems less likely.

Wait, but the statement is simply acknowledging parentage, which might not be against interest. Alternatively, if the man was acknowledging a child outside of marriage, that could be against his interest, but it's not clear.

Given the options, I think the best choice is I: pedigree exception. So the court would overrule the objection, so the answer is I.

The question revolves around whether the butler's testimony about the wealthy man's statement is admissible. The key issue is whether the statement qualifies as hearsay and, if so, whether an exception applies. The butler's testimony about the man's acknowledgment of paternity is hearsay, but it may fall under the pedigree exception, which allows statements about family matters, especially parentage, made by someone with knowledge. Therefore, the court is likely to overrule the objection.
