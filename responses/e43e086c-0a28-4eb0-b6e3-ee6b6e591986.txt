Okay, so I've got this problem about the Argo Scholarship Fund, and I need to figure out how much money is needed to set it up. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The fund consists of twenty scholarships, each worth $1,000. So, every year, they give out 20 x $1,000 = $20,000 in scholarships. Got that. The fund needs to last for twenty years, and the annual interest rate is 5%. The question is asking how much money is needed to establish the fund, which I think means finding the present value that will grow over time to meet the scholarship payments.

Hmm, this sounds like an annuity problem. Specifically, it's about finding the present value of an ordinary annuity because the payments (scholarships) are made at the end of each period (year). The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT x [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]

Where:
- PV is the present value (the amount we need to find)
- PMT is the annual payment (which is $20,000 here)
- r is the annual interest rate (5%, so 0.05)
- n is the number of years (20 years)

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up the formulas. Sometimes I get confused between present value and future value. Since the fund is being established now and needs to provide payments for 20 years, we're dealing with the present value of the total payments. So yes, the annuity present value formula is the right approach.

Let me plug in the numbers:

PMT = 20,000
r = 0.05
n = 20

So PV = 20,000 x [(1 - (1 + 0.05)^-20) / 0.05]

First, I need to calculate (1 + 0.05)^-20. Let me compute that. 1.05 to the power of -20 is the same as 1 divided by (1.05^20). I remember that 1.05^20 is approximately 2.6533, so 1/2.6533 is about 0.3769. 

Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the present value interest factor of an annuity, which is [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r.

So, calculating [1 - (1.05)^-20] / 0.05.

Let me compute (1.05)^-20. Using a calculator, 1.05^20 is approximately 2.6533, so (1.05)^-20 is about 0.3769.

So, 1 - 0.3769 = 0.6231.

Divide that by 0.05: 0.6231 / 0.05 = 12.462.

So the present value factor is 12.462. Multiply that by the annual payment of $20,000: 20,000 x 12.462 = 249,240. Wait, that can't be right because the answer options are all under $30,000. Did I make a mistake?

Wait a minute, no. Oh! Wait, no, the scholarship is $1,000 each, and there are 20 scholarships, so total annual payment is $20,000. So the calculation seems correct, but the answer options don't go that high. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read again. The fund consists of twenty scholarships of $1,000 each. So each year, they give out 20 scholarships, each $1,000, so total $20,000 per year. The fund needs to last for 20 years, so the present value is the amount needed now to ensure that $20,000 is paid each year for 20 years, with 5% interest.

But the options given are much lower, like up to $30,000. So I must have made a mistake in my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the future value instead of the present value? Or maybe it's a different kind of annuity.

Wait, no, the question is about establishing the fund now, so present value is correct. But the options are way lower than my calculation. Wait, maybe I messed up the number of periods. Let me check again.

Wait, 20 scholarships each of $1,000, so each year, 20 x 1,000 = 20,000. So PMT is 20,000. The interest rate is 5%, so 0.05. The number of periods is 20 years.

So PV = 20,000 * [(1 - 1.05^-20)/0.05]

Let me compute each part again.

1.05^20 is approximately 2.6533. So 1.05^-20 is 1/2.6533 ≈ 0.3769.

1 - 0.3769 = 0.6231.

0.6231 / 0.05 = 12.462.

So 20,000 * 12.462 = 249,240. But that's way higher than the options. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, maybe the problem is that the scholarships are each $1,000, and there are 20 scholarships, but perhaps the total is $20,000, but perhaps the payments are for 20 years, so each year, it's $20,000. So the calculation as I did it is correct, but the answer doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the scholarships are $1,000 each, but each scholarship is given once, and there are 20 scholarships over 20 years. So each year, one scholarship is given, $1,000. So the total annual payment would be $1,000, not $20,000. That would make more sense with the answer options.

Wait, that's a different interpretation. Let me read the question again: "The Argo Scholarship Fund consists of twenty scholarships of $1,000 each." So the fund is set up with 20 scholarships, each $1,000. So each year, they give out 20 scholarships? Or is it that the total fund is twenty scholarships, so perhaps over 20 years, each year one scholarship is given. That would make the annual payment $1,000, not $20,000.

Wait, that's a crucial point. Let me parse the wording: "the Argo Scholarship Fund consists of twenty scholarships of $1,000 each." It doesn't specify whether they're given annually or over the 20 years. But the next part says, "if this fund is to last for twenty years," implying that the fund needs to provide scholarships for 20 years. So perhaps each year, one scholarship is given, totaling 20 scholarships over 20 years, each $1,000.

Wait, but the wording says "consists of twenty scholarships of $1,000 each." So the total value is 20 * 1,000 = $20,000. But the fund is supposed to last for 20 years, so perhaps each year, one scholarship is given, meaning that the annual payment is $1,000. That would make the present value calculation much lower.

Let me recalculate with PMT = $1,000, n=20, r=5%.

PV = 1,000 * [(1 - 1.05^-20)/0.05]

We already calculated [(1 - 1.05^-20)/0.05] as 12.462, so 1,000 * 12.462 = 12,462. That's option A.

But wait, the initial assumption was that PMT is $20,000 because 20 scholarships each year. But that led to an answer not in the options. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that each year, one scholarship is given, so PMT is $1,000.

But the problem says "the fund is to last for twenty years," which suggests that the scholarships are given annually for 20 years, but each year, twenty scholarships are given. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 20 scholarships each year would require $20,000 annually, but that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the fund is to provide 20 scholarships in total, each worth $1,000, but spread over 20 years, meaning one scholarship per year. So each year, one $1,000 scholarship is given, and the fund lasts 20 years, providing 20 scholarships in total. That would make PMT = $1,000, and the present value would be 12,462, which is option A.

But the wording says "the fund is to last for twenty years," which suggests that the fund needs to make payments for 20 years, but it's not clear if it's 20 scholarships in total or 20 each year. The initial statement says "consists of twenty scholarships of $1,000 each," which might imply that the total amount is $20,000, but that's just the initial setup. The fund needs to last 20 years, so it's about the present value of an annuity where each payment is $20,000 for 20 years, which would require a much larger initial amount than the options provided.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the scholarships are $1,000 each, and there are 20 scholarships to be given over 20 years, meaning one each year. So the annual payment is $1,000, and the present value would be 12,462, which is option A. But the options include C as $20,000, which is the total amount of scholarships, but that's the future value, not the present value.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the future value, but that doesn't make sense because the fund is being established now, so present value is needed.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the total amount needed is the sum of the scholarships, which is $20,000, but that's without considering interest. The question is asking for the amount needed now, considering 5% interest over 20 years. So the present value would be less than $20,000. But let's calculate it.

If the total amount needed in 20 years is $20,000, then the present value would be 20,000 / (1.05)^20. We know (1.05)^20 is about 2.6533, so 20,000 / 2.6533 ≈ 7,547. That's not an option either.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me go back to the original problem. The fund consists of twenty scholarships of $1,000 each. So the total is $20,000. If the fund is to last for twenty years, and the interest rate is 5%, what's the amount needed to establish it.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the future value, but that doesn't make sense because you're establishing the fund now. Alternatively, maybe it's a perpetuity, but the problem says twenty years, so it's a finite annuity.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that each year, the fund needs to pay out $20,000 (20 scholarships x $1,000). So the present value is the amount needed now to fund those 20 annual payments of $20,000 each, with a 5% interest rate.

So using the present value of annuity formula:

PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]

PMT = 20,000
r = 0.05
n = 20

So PV = 20,000 * [(1 - 1.05^-20)/0.05]

As calculated earlier, [(1 - 1.05^-20)/0.05] ≈ 12.462, so 20,000 * 12.462 ≈ 249,240. But the options don't have this number. So perhaps the problem is structured differently.

Wait, perhaps the scholarships are $1,000 each, and there are 20 scholarships to be given over 20 years, meaning one scholarship per year. So PMT is $1,000, n=20, r=5%.

So PV = 1,000 * 12.462 ≈ 12,462, which is option A.

But why does the problem say the fund consists of twenty scholarships of $1,000 each? That would imply that the total is $20,000, but if the fund is to last 20 years, perhaps each year, they give out one scholarship, so the total is $20,000 over 20 years, which would mean each year, $1,000 is paid out.

So the correct calculation would be for an annuity of $1,000 per year for 20 years at 5%, which gives PV ≈ $12,462, option A.

But earlier, I thought the total scholarships are $20,000, but that's the total amount to be given out. The present value would be less, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler, and the answer is $20,000, option C, but that doesn't account for interest.

Wait, but the question is asking for the amount needed to establish the fund, considering the interest. So without interest, it's $20,000, but with 5% interest, the present value would be less. So option C is $20,000, which is the total amount without considering the time value of money. But the correct answer should be the present value, which is less than $20,000. However, the options include A as $12,462, which matches the calculation for the present value of a $1,000 annual payment.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the fund needs to provide $20,000 each year for 20 years, so the present value is 249,240, but that's not an option. So I must have misread the problem.

Wait, perhaps the scholarships are $1,000 each, and there are 20 scholarships to be given in total, but spread over 20 years, so each year, one scholarship is given. Therefore, the annual payment is $1,000, and the present value is 12,462, option A.

But let me check the options again:

A: $12,462

C: $20,000

So the correct answer would be A, but I'm a bit confused because the initial statement about twenty scholarships of $1,000 each could be interpreted as needing $20,000 in total, but the fund needs to last 20 years, so the present value is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the fund needs to have $20,000 in it initially, and with 5% interest, it will grow to more than that, but that doesn't make sense because the question is about the amount needed to establish it, which is the present value.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the future value of the present amount to see if it matches the total scholarships. For example, if I invest X now at 5% for 20 years, the future value should be $20,000.

FV = PV * (1 + r)^n

20,000 = PV * (1.05)^20

So PV = 20,000 / (1.05)^20 ≈ 20,000 / 2.6533 ≈ 7,547. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the future value, but that would be $20,000 in 20 years, which would require a present value of about $7,547, but that's not an option either.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the scholarships are to be given annually, but the total is $20,000, and the fund needs to last 20 years, so the present value is calculated as the amount needed now to fund 20 annual payments of $1,000 each, which would be 12,462, option A.

But the initial statement says the fund consists of twenty scholarships of $1,000 each, which might imply that each year, twenty scholarships are given, totaling $20,000 annually. But the present value for that is way higher than the options provided.

Given the options, the only one that makes sense with the present value calculation for an annual payment of $1,000 is option A: $12,462.
</think>

The problem requires calculating the present value of an ordinary annuity to determine the amount needed to establish the Argo Scholarship Fund. The fund must provide $1,000 scholarships annually for 20 years, with an annual interest rate of 5%. Using the present value of an annuity formula:

\[
PV = PMT \times \left( \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( PMT = \$1,000 \) (annual scholarship payment),
- \( r = 0.05 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( n = 20 \) (number of years).

First, calculate the present value factor:

\[
\frac{1 - (1 + 0.05)^{-20}}{0.05} \approx 12.462
\]

Then, multiply by the annual payment:

\[
PV = 1,000 \times 12.462 = \$12,462
\]

This matches option A. The other options either represent incorrect interpretations of the problem or miscalculations.
