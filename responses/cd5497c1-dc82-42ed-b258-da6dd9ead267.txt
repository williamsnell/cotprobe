Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. The question is: A number x equals 2^15 multiplied by 3^6. I need to find which number's cube equals x. The options are labeled from A to J, with numbers like 125, 343, 64, and so on.

Hmm, alright, so first, I think I should understand what the problem is asking. So x is given as 2^15 * 3^6. And I have to find a number, let's call it y, such that y cubed equals x. In other words, y^3 = x. So, y is the cube root of x.

To find y, I can take the cube root of x. But since x is expressed in terms of prime factors (2 and 3), maybe I can break it down that way. Remember that when you take the cube root, you can apply it to each prime factor separately.

So, x = 2^15 * 3^6. Let me write that as (2^15) * (3^6). Now, taking the cube root of x would mean taking the cube root of each part. So, cube root of 2^15 is 2^(15/3) = 2^5. Similarly, cube root of 3^6 is 3^(6/3) = 3^2.

Let me calculate those exponents. 2^5 is 32, and 3^2 is 9. So, y = 32 * 9. Wait, 32 times 9 is... let me do that multiplication. 30*9 is 270, and 2*9 is 18, so 270+18 is 288. So y would be 288. Hmm, but looking at the options, J is 288. So that's one possibility.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponents. Let's see: 2^15 divided by 3 is indeed 5, because 5*3 is 15. And 3^6 divided by 3 is 2, because 2*3 is 6. So that part seems right.

So y = 2^5 * 3^2 = 32 * 9 = 288. So the answer should be option J: 288.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 32 times 9 is 288? Well, 30*9 is 270, plus 2*9 is 18, so 270+18 is 288. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Since y^3 = x, and x = 2^15 *3^6, then y must be 2^(15/3) *3^(6/3) = 2^5 *3^2, which is the same as before. So y is 2^5 *3^2, which is 32*9=288. So yeah, J is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A:125, B:343, C:64, D:216, E:512, F:1728, G:1000, H:27, I:121, J:288. So J is indeed one of the options, so that's good.

Wait another thought: perhaps I can factor the options to see which one, when cubed, gives x. That might be a good way to verify.

Let me take each option and cube it to see if it equals 2^15 *3^6.

Starting with option J: 288. Let's factor 288. 288 divided by 2 is 144, then 72, 36, 18, 9. So that's 2^5 (since I divided by 2 five times) and 9 is 3^2. So 288 is 2^5 *3^2. So when I cube it, it becomes (2^5 *3^2)^3 = 2^(15) *3^(6), which is exactly x. So that checks out.

Just to make sure, let's quickly check another option, say D:216. 216 is 6^3, which is (2*3)^3 = 2^3*3^3. So cubing 216 would give (2^3*3^3)^3 = 2^9 *3^9, which is way larger than x (which is 2^15 *3^6). So D is not the answer.

Similarly, let's take option F:1728. 1728 is 12^3, which is (2^2*3)^3 = 2^6*3^3. Cubing that would be 2^18*3^9, which is much bigger than x. So not F.

Option E:512. 512 is 8^3, which is 2^9. Cubed, it's 2^27, which is way more than 2^15. So E is not right.

Option D:216, as we saw, gives 2^9*3^9 when cubed, which is higher than x's exponents.

Option H:27 is 3^3. Cubed, it's 3^9, which is higher than x's 3^6.

Option G:1000 is 10^3, which is 2^3*5^3. Cubed would have 5s, which x doesn't have, so G is out.

Option I:121 is 11^2, and cubed would be 11^6, which doesn't match.

Option C:64 is 2^6. Cubed is 2^18, which is higher than x's 2^15.

Option B:343 is 7^3. Cubed would be 7^9, which doesn't match.

Option A:125 is 5^3. Cubed would be 5^9, which isn't in x.

So yeah, only option J:288, when cubed, gives exactly x. So the correct answer must be J.

The number \( x \) is given as \( 2^{15} \cdot 3^6 \). To find a number \( y \) such that \( y^3 = x \), we take the cube root of \( x \). This gives \( y = 2^{5} \cdot 3^{2} = 32 \cdot 9 = 288 \). Verifying by cubing 288 confirms it equals \( x \). Thus, the correct answer is J.

Answer: J
