Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The following excerpt is from a speech by Vladimir I. Lenin.
The independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task—in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it—in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.
—Vladimir I. Lenin Industrialization of the Country and the Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U., November 19,1928
What was the result of Stalin's attempt to fix this problem?

Options:

A: The Soviet Union saw steady growth in agriculture but industrial production fell behind.
B: The Soviet Union saw temporary growth in industry, followed by a rapid decline.
C: The Soviet Union saw steady growth in industry and a decline in agriculture.
D: The Soviet Union saw steady decline in both industry and agriculture.
E: The Soviet Union saw a decline in both industry and agriculture, but then rebounded.
F: The Soviet Union's industrial and agricultural sectors remained stagnant.
G: The Soviet Union saw a rapid growth in both industry and agriculture, followed by a catastrophic collapse.
H: The Soviet Union saw steady growth in both industry and agriculture.
I: The Soviet Union saw a decline in industry but steady growth in agriculture.
J: The Soviet Union became the world's leading industrial power.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Soviet Union's economic policies under Stalin, specifically regarding the results of his attempt to fix the problem Lenin talked about. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the context from Lenin's speech. Lenin is emphasizing the importance of industrialization for the Soviet Union's defense and overall socialist construction. He mentions that the country can't rely indefinitely on a combination of advanced socialist industry and the peasants' small, scattered, and backward agriculture. He stresses that agriculture needs to be modernized and brought up to the level of industry, otherwise, capitalism might return.

So the problem here is the imbalance between a more developed industrial sector and the underdeveloped agricultural sector. Lenin is pushing for rapid industrialization and collectivization of agriculture to bridge this gap. Now, the question is asking about the result of Stalin's attempt to fix this problem.

I remember that after Lenin, Stalin took over and implemented the Five-Year Plans, focusing heavily on industrialization. He also pushed for collectivization of agriculture, which involved forcing peasants into collective farms (kolkhozy). The idea was to modernize both sectors to support the socialist economy and prevent the return of capitalism.

What were the outcomes of these policies? From what I've studied, Stalin's first Five-Year Plan (1928–1932) led to rapid industrial growth. The Soviet Union's industrial output increased significantly, making it one of the leading industrial nations by the end of the 1930s. This was part of the answer—so industry did grow, but what about agriculture?

The collectivization of agriculture was a massive effort, but it didn't go smoothly. Many peasants resisted, and the process was often forcible, leading to resentment. While some agricultural production increased in the short term due to better organization and mechanization, it wasn't sustainable. The collectivization led to a decline in agricultural efficiency and productivity over time because the state took a large portion of the produce (through the grain taxes and later through collectivization), leaving little for the peasants. This contributed to the Soviet famine, particularly the Holodomor in Ukraine in 1932-33.

So, under Stalin, industry saw rapid growth, especially in heavy industry, which was crucial for defense. However, agriculture struggled. The initial push might have caused some temporary growth, but it wasn't sustained. In fact, it led to long-term issues because the agricultural sector couldn't keep up with the demands of the state, which was focused on industrialization.

Looking at the options:

A: Steady growth in agriculture, industry behind. No, because agriculture was a problem.

B: Temporary growth in industry, then rapid decline. Not sure, but I think industry kept growing, albeit with issues.

C: Steady growth in industry, decline in agriculture. This seems plausible because industry grew, but agriculture didn't.

D: Decline in both. No, industry grew, so this isn't right.

E: Decline in both, then rebound. Not matching what happened under Stalin's initial push.

F: Stagnation in both. No, industry was growing.

G: Rapid growth in both, then collapse. Not exactly; agriculture had issues, and industry did grow but faced problems later, but the collapse part is more associated with post-Stalin times.

H: Growth in both. No, because agriculture didn't keep up.

I: Decline in industry but growth in agriculture. No, industry grew, so this is wrong.

J: Became the world's leading industrial power. That's true, but the question is about the result of fixing the problem, which was the imbalance between industry and agriculture. So while J is correct in part, the other part (agriculture) didn't do well.

Wait, but the options are about the result of Stalin's attempt. So, the problem was the imbalance. Stalin's policies led to rapid industrialization, which addressed the industrial side, but agriculture suffered. So the result was that industry grew, but agriculture declined or couldn't keep up, leading to issues like famines.

Looking back at the options, option C says: The Soviet Union saw steady growth in industry and a decline in agriculture. That seems to fit.

Another thought: Did the agricultural output decline or just stagnate? I think it had periods of decline, especially during collectivization. So the overall trend was a decline in agriculture.

So the result was that industry grew steadily, but agriculture declined, making option C correct.

The result of Stalin's attempt to fix the problem was steady growth in industry and a decline in agriculture.
