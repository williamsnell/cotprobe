Question:

A random sample of 25 men and a separate random sample of 25 women are selected to answer questions about attitudes toward abortion. The answers were categorized as "pro-life" or "pro-choice." Which of the following is the proper null hypothesis for this situation?

Options:

A: The proportion of "pro-life" men is the same as the proportion of "pro-life" women.
B: The proportion of "pro-life" women is related to the proportion of "pro-choice" men.
C: The proportion of "pro-choice" women is the same as the proportion of "pro-life" men.
D: The proportion of "pro-choice" men is unrelated to the proportion of "pro-life" women.
E: The proportion of "pro-choice" men is greater than the proportion of "pro-choice" women.
F: The proportion of "pro-life" men is greater than the proportion of "pro-life" women.
G: The proportion of "pro-choice" men is the same as the proportion of "pro-life" women.
H: The variables "gender" and "attitude toward abortion" are related.

Okay, so I've got this statistics question in front of me about setting up a null hypothesis. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that a random sample of 25 men and 25 women were selected to answer questions about their attitudes towards abortion. The answers were categorized as either "pro-life" or "pro-choice." The task is to determine the proper null hypothesis from the given options.

First, I remember that a null hypothesis (Hâ‚€) typically states that there's no significant difference between the groups or that there's no relationship between variables. It's the default assumption that there's no effect or no association.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The proportion of "pro-life" men is the same as the proportion of "pro-life" women. This seems to suggest that within each group (men and women), the proportion of pro-life is equal. But wait, the samples are separate, so maybe this is about comparing the same category across genders. Hmm.

Option B: The proportion of "pro-life" women is related to the proportion of "pro-choice" men. This sounds like it's talking about a relationship between two different groups, but I'm not sure how this fits into a null hypothesis. Null hypotheses usually don't state relationships unless it's about independence.

Option C: The proportion of "pro-choice" women is the same as the proportion of "pro-life" men. This is comparing two different categories across genders, but I'm not sure if this is the standard approach for a null hypothesis.

Option D: The proportion of "pro-choice" men is unrelated to the proportion of "pro-life" women. Again, this is about the relationship between two different groups, but I'm not sure if this is the correct way to frame a null hypothesis in this context.

Option E: The proportion of "pro-choice" men is greater than the proportion of "pro-choice" women. This is a directional hypothesis, which is more of an alternative hypothesis, not a null.

Option F: The proportion of "pro-life" men is greater than the proportion of "pro-life" women. Similarly, this is a directional statement and likely an alternative hypothesis.

Option G: The proportion of "pro-choice" men is the same as the proportion of "pro-life" women. This is comparing pro-choice men to pro-life women, but I'm not sure if this is the right way to frame the null. The null should probably be about whether the proportions are the same, not necessarily matching specific opposing categories.

Option H: The variables "gender" and "attitude toward abortion" are related. This seems more like a statement about the relationship between two variables, which would be the alternative hypothesis. The null would typically state that there's no relationship.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question is about attitudes towards abortion, categorized as pro-life or pro-choice. So the variables are gender (male vs. female) and attitude (pro-life vs. pro-choice). So, the null hypothesis would be that these two variables are independent, meaning there's no association between them. That would mean that the proportions of pro-life and pro-choice responses are the same across genders.

Looking back, Option A says the proportion of pro-life men is the same as pro-life women. But that's within the same category (pro-life), comparing across genders. Alternatively, the null hypothesis should be that the overall attitudes are the same between men and women, regardless of the specific pro-life or pro-choice labels.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. In a chi-square test for independence, the null hypothesis is that the two variables are independent. So, the correct null would be that there's no association between gender and attitude. That would correspond to Option H. But wait, Option H says the variables are related, which would be the alternative hypothesis, not the null. Wait, no, the null is that they are not related. So, H is saying they are related, which would be the alternative, not the null. So the null would be that they are unrelated.

Wait, looking again, Option H says "The variables 'gender' and 'attitude toward abortion' are related." So the null hypothesis should be the opposite: that they are unrelated. But none of the options directly state that. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are about proportions. So perhaps the correct null is that the proportion of pro-life men equals the proportion of pro-life women, which is Option A. Because that's a direct comparison between the two groups on the same attitude. Alternatively, perhaps the null is that there's no difference between men and women in their attitudes, which could be that the proportions are equal, but not necessarily the same across the pro-life and pro-choice categories.

Wait, no. The null hypothesis for a 2x2 contingency table (gender vs. attitude) would be that the two variables are independent, i.e., the proportion of pro-life is the same for men and women. So that would be Option A: the proportion of "pro-life" men is the same as the proportion of "pro-life" women.

Alternatively, some might frame the null as the variables being unrelated, which would be Option H, but the wording there is that they are related. So the null would be that they are not related, but that's not an option. Wait, no, Option H says they are related, so the correct null would be the opposite, but that's not listed. So perhaps the correct answer is Option A, which directly states equality in the proportion of pro-life between men and women.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the null for a chi-square is phrased as the variables being independent, which would mean that the distribution of attitudes is the same across genders. So, the proportion of pro-life men equals pro-life women, and similarly for pro-choice. So Option A is about pro-life, but the overall null would encompass all categories. But perhaps the question is only focusing on the pro-life category.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct null is that the variables are unrelated, which is Option H, but that's phrased as the variables being related. Wait, no, the null hypothesis is that the variables are unrelated (independent), so the alternative is that they are related. So Option H would be the alternative hypothesis, not the null.

So, perhaps the correct null hypothesis is that the proportion of pro-life men equals the proportion of pro-life women. That would be Option A.

The question asks for the proper null hypothesis when comparing attitudes toward abortion between men and women. A null hypothesis typically states that there is no significant difference or no relationship between variables. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** states that the proportion of "pro-life" men is the same as the proportion of "pro-life" women. This directly compares the same attitude category across genders, which aligns with the idea of testing for equality between groups.
- **Option H** suggests that "gender" and "attitude toward abortion" are related, which would be the alternative hypothesis, not the null.
- Other options either compare different categories (e.g., pro-choice men vs. pro-life women) or make directional statements, which are less appropriate for a null hypothesis.

The most appropriate null hypothesis is that the proportion of "pro-life" men equals the proportion of "pro-life" women, as it directly tests for equality within the same attitude category across genders.
