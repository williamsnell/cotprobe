Okay, so I have this problem where a vessel is completely filled with liquid water and then sealed. The initial temperature is 13.56°C, and the pressure is 1.00 bar. Then, the temperature is raised to 82.0°C. I need to find the new pressure inside the vessel.

Hmm, the vessel is sealed, so the volume can't change, right? But wait, the vessel itself might expand when heated. Oh, because both the vessel and the water are subject to thermal expansion. Since the vessel is made of some material, it will expand a bit when the temperature increases. But because the vessel is sealed, the water can't expand freely either. So, the pressure inside will increase due to the thermal expansion of both the vessel and the water.

I remember that thermal expansion affects both the container and the substance inside. The formula for pressure change due to thermal expansion involves the coefficients of volume expansion for both the vessel and the water, as well as the compressibility of the water.

Wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, the pressure increase ΔP can be calculated using the equation that accounts for the differential expansion between the vessel and the water. The formula is something like ΔP = β_water * κ_water * ΔT / (1 - β_vessel * β_water * ΔT), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think it's ΔP = κ_water * P_initial * (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT. Or maybe it's ΔP = κ_water * (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT multiplied by some factor. I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think again. The vessel expands, which would allow some expansion of the water, but since the vessel can't expand as much as the water (assuming β_water > β_vessel), the excess expansion of the water is constrained, leading to an increase in pressure.

The general approach is to consider the change in volume of the water when heated without constraints, which would be ΔV = V_initial * β_water * ΔT. But since the vessel's volume also changes, ΔV_vessel = V_initial * β_vessel * ΔT. The actual change in volume that the water can achieve is ΔV_water_available = V_initial * (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT. But since the water is incompressible (well, sort of), this excess volume is accommodated by an increase in pressure, which compresses the water.

The compressibility κ relates the volume change to the pressure change. The formula for the pressure change would then be ΔP = (ΔV_water_available) / (κ_water * V_initial). Substituting ΔV_water_available, we get ΔP = (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT / κ_water.

Wait, no, let me write it correctly. The formula is ΔP = (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT / (1/κ_water). Wait, no, because κ is defined as ΔV/V per unit pressure, so 1/κ would be the bulk modulus. So the correct formula should involve the bulk modulus, which is B = 1/κ.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔP = κ_water * (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT

Wait, no, that's not right. Let's think in terms of dimensional analysis. κ has units of inverse pressure (like bar^-1), β is inverse Kelvin. So (β_water - β_vessel) is per K, ΔT is in K. So (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT is unitless. Then multiplying by κ (bar^-1) gives 1/bar. Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right for pressure.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I think the formula is:

ΔP = (β_water - β_vessel) * (ΔT) / (1/κ_water)

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Alternatively, the pressure change is given by:

ΔP = κ_water * (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT * P_initial

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the derivation.

The volume change of water if unconstrained would be ΔV_water = V0 * β_water * ΔT.

But since the vessel also expands, the available volume change is ΔV_available = V0 * (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT.

This ΔV_available must be accommodated by compression of the water under pressure. The change in volume due to pressure is ΔV = -κ_water * V0 * ΔP.

So setting ΔV_available = -ΔV, we get V0*(β_water - β_vessel)*ΔT = κ_water * V0 * ΔP.

Cancel V0 from both sides: (β_water - β_vessel)*ΔT = κ_water * ΔP.

So solving for ΔP: ΔP = (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT / κ_water.

Wait, that makes sense. So yes, that's the correct formula. Because the available volume change is (β_water - β_vessel)ΔT, which must equal the volume change due to pressure, which is κ_water * ΔP (since ΔV = κ * V * ΔP, but since ΔP is positive when pressure increases, the ΔV would be negative, but here we're considering the magnitude).

So, the formula is:

ΔP = (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT / κ_water

But wait, let me check the units. β is 1/K, ΔT is K, so numerator is unitless. κ_water is bar^-1. So ΔP has units of bar^-1 * (unitless) → bar^-1? That can't be right. Wait, no, because:

Wait, κ is in bar^-1, so 1/κ is bar.

Wait, no, in the formula it's (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT → unit is (1/K) * K → unitless.

κ_water is 1/bar, so ΔP = (unitless) / (1/bar) ) → bar. Which makes sense.

So yes, the formula is ΔP = (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT / κ_water.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial pressure is 1 bar, but in the formula, I don't see P_initial appearing. That's confusing because I thought the pressure change would depend on the initial pressure. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me rederive this. The available volume change is (β_water - β_vessel) * V0 * ΔT. The compression of water due to pressure change ΔP is ΔV = -κ_water * V0 * ΔP.

Setting them equal (since the water can't expand beyond the vessel's expansion), so:

(β_water - β_vessel) * V0 * ΔT = -κ_water * V0 * ΔP.

Cancel V0: (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT = -κ_water * ΔP.

So rearranging, ΔP = (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT / κ_water.

Wait, but if β_water > β_vessel, then (β_water - β_vessel) is positive, ΔT is positive, so ΔP is positive, which makes sense because the pressure increases.

So, plugging in the numbers:

β_water = 2.04e-4 K^-1,

β_vessel = 1.42e-4 K^-1,

ΔT = 82.0 - 13.56 = 68.44 K.

κ_water = 4.59e-5 bar^-1.

So compute numerator: (2.04e-4 - 1.42e-4) = 0.62e-4 = 6.2e-5 per K.

Multiply by ΔT: 6.2e-5 * 68.44 ≈ 

Let me compute that:

6.2e-5 * 68.44 = 6.2 * 68.44 * 1e-5.

6.2 * 68.44 ≈ 6 * 68 = 408, plus 0.2*68=13.6 → 421.6, plus 6.2*0.44=2.728 → total approx 424.328.

So 424.328e-5 → 4.24328e-3.

Then, divide by κ_water =4.59e-5 bar^-1.

So ΔP = 4.24328e-3 / 4.59e-5 ≈ 

Calculate 4.24328e-3 / 4.59e-5.

That's the same as (4.24328 / 4.59) * (1e-3 / 1e-5) ) → (approx 0.9245) * 100 → ~92.45 bar.

Wait, but wait, that's the change in pressure. So the new pressure P = P_initial + ΔP = 1 + 92.45 → 93.45 bar.

Looking at the options, D is 93.4 bar. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations more accurately.

Compute (β_water - β_vessel) = 2.04e-4 - 1.42e-4 = 0.62e-4 = 6.2e-5.

ΔT = 82.0 - 13.56 = 68.44 K.

So 6.2e-5 * 68.44 = 6.2 * 68.44 * 1e-5.

Compute 6.2 * 68.44:

6 * 68.44 = 410.64

0.2 * 68.44 = 13.688

Total: 410.64 +13.688 = 424.328e-5 → 4.24328e-3.

Then 4.24328e-3 / 4.59e-5 bar^-1.

Compute 4.24328e-3 / 4.59e-5 → let's compute 4.24328 /4.59 = approx 0.9245.

Then, 0.9245 * (1e-3 / 1e-5) = 0.9245 * 100 = 92.45 bar.

So ΔP ≈92.45 bar, so total P =1 +92.45=93.45 bar. So option D is 93.4 bar.

The pressure increase is calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta P = \frac{(\beta_{\text{water}} - \beta_{\text{vessel}}) \cdot \Delta T}{\kappa_{\text{water}}}
\]

Where:
- \(\beta_{\text{water}} = 2.04 \times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1}\),
- \(\beta_{\text{vessel}} = 1.42 \times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1}\),
- \(\Delta T = 82.0 - 13.56 = 68.44 \, \mathrm{K}\),
- \(\kappa_{\text{water}} = 4.59 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{bar}^{-1}\).

1. Compute \((\beta_{\text{water}} - \beta_{\text{vessel}})\):
   \[
   2.04 \times 10^{-4} - 1.42 \times 10^{-4} = 0.62 \times 10^{-4} = 6.2 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1}.
   \]

2. Multiply by \(\Delta T\):
   \[
   6.2 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 68.44 = 4.24328 \times 10^{-3}.
   \]

3. Divide by \(\kappa_{\text{water}}\):
   \[
   \frac{4.24328 \times 10^{-3}}{4.59 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 92.45 \, \mathrm{bar}.
   \]

4. Add the initial pressure:
   \[
   P_{\text{final}} = 1.00 + 92.45 = 93.45 \, \mathrm{bar}.
   \]

The closest option is **93.4 bar**.
