Okay, so I have this question about issues management and crisis management, and I need to figure out which statement is NOT true for both. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll recall what I know about these two areas. Issues management is about handling ongoing or potential issues that could affect an organization. It's more proactive, I think, because it's about anticipating and managing issues before they become crises. On the other hand, crisis management is about dealing with sudden, severe events that threaten the organization. It's more reactive because crises usually happen unexpectedly and require immediate action.

Now, looking at the options:

A: They both are reactive approaches to handle issues. Hmm, I think issues management is more proactive, while crisis management is definitely reactive. So maybe A is not true for both.

B: Both have the potential to damage an organization's reputation. That makes sense because both issues and crises can harm reputation if not handled well. So B is true for both.

C: They both deal with acute risks. Acute risks are sudden and severe. Crisis management definitely deals with acute risks, but issues management might deal with both acute and chronic issues. So maybe C isn't entirely accurate for both, but I'm not sure yet.

D: New organizational practices are developed as a result of each. I think both can lead to improvements, so D is true for both.

E: Both require a swift response time. Crisis management definitely needs a quick response, but issues management might allow for a more measured response. So E might not be true for both.

F: Both can lead to improvement in organizational practices. Yes, both can result in better practices to prevent future issues, so F is true.

G: They both require research monitoring. I think both do require some research and monitoring to understand the issues or potential crises. So G is true.

H: Both are planned in advance and implemented when needed. Issues management is planned, but crisis management is more about having a plan in place when a crisis hits. So H might be true for both because they both have plans, but I'm not entirely certain.

I: Both require a change in organizational structure. I'm not sure. Maybe only in certain cases, but I don't think this is necessarily true for both. It might not be a common requirement.

Wait, going back to option A. Issues management is more proactive, so it's not just reactive. So A says both are reactive, which would make A not true for both. So A is the statement that is NOT true.

But let me double-check other options. Option H says both are planned in advance. Issues management involves planning, yes. Crisis management also involves having a crisis plan, so H is true for both. Option E: Swift response. Issues might require a quicker response than some chronic issues, but crises definitely need swift action. So E is true for both.

So the statement that is NOT true for both would be A, because issues management isn't just reactive; it's proactive, whereas crisis is reactive.

The statement that is NOT true for both issues management and crisis management is **A**. 

A: They both are reactive approaches to handle issues.  
This is not true because issues management is proactive, while crisis management is reactive.

Answer: A
