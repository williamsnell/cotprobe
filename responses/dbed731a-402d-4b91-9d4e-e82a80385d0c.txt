Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this developmental psychology question. The question is asking for three approaches to the study of developmental psychology, and I have to choose from options A to J.

First, I'll recall what developmental psychology is about. It's the study of how people develop over their lifespan, right? So, the approaches would be different theories or methods used to understand this development.

I remember that there are several major theories or approaches. Let me think: there's the biological approach, which looks at genetics, brain development, and physical maturation. Then there's the psychodynamic approach, which is about unconscious conflicts and stages of development, like what Freud talked about. There's also the cognitive approach, focusing on how children think and process information. The social learning theory is about how people learn by observing others. The behavioral approach is about observable behaviors and conditioning. Constructivism is another one, which is about how individuals construct their own knowledge and understanding. Evolutionary psychology looks at how evolution has shaped our behaviors and development. Ecological systems theory considers the environment and different systems influencing development, like microsystem, mesosystem, etc.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Biological, psychoanalytic, and social learning. That could work because those are all valid approaches. But wait, psychoanalytic is a subset of psychodynamic, so maybe that's correct.

Option B: Learning, constructivist, and information processing. Information processing is a cognitive approach, so this might also be a good set.

Option C: Biological, evolutionary, and cognitive. These are definitely major approaches. I think this is a strong candidate because all three are well-known.

Option D: Contextual, evolutionary, and psychodynamic. Contextual might relate to ecological or environmental factors, but I'm not sure if it's a standard approach term.

Option E: Sociocultural, learning, and ecological. Sociocultural is about culture's role, learning is behavioral/social, and ecological is environmental. That's a mix but I'm not sure if these are the most standard trio.

Option F: Behavioral, cognitive, and existential. Existential is more about personal meaning and freedom, which I don't think is one of the mainstream approaches in developmental psychology.

Option G: Mechanistic, organismic, and psychoanalytic. Mechanistic might relate to biological, but organismic is a broader term, and psychoanalytic is again a specific theory.

Option H: Neuroscientific, psychosexual, and sociocultural. Neuroscientific is a modern approach, psychosexual is Freudian, and sociocultural is about society's influence. Not sure if this is the trio the question is looking for.

Option I: Cognitive, behavioral, and humanistic. Humanistic is about self-actualization, which is a valid approach but maybe not the first three that come to mind.

Option J: Ecological, social, and cognitive-behavioral. These are all valid, but I'm not sure if they are the primary trio.

So, considering the options, I think option C: Biological, evolutionary, and cognitive is a solid choice. These three are often cited as major approaches. The biological approach looks at physical and genetic factors, evolutionary considers how traits develop through evolution, and cognitive focuses on mental processes and information processing. That makes sense as a trio covering different aspects of development.

The correct answer is C: Biological, evolutionary, and cognitive. These approaches cover the physical, evolutionary, and mental aspects of development.
