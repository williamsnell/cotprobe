Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the width of a belt for a motor. Hmm, let's see. The motor is a squirrel cage induction motor rated at 25 hp and 1500 rpm. The pulley is 15 inches in diameter, and the belt is a medium double-ply flat leather belt. The environment is dusty, but I'm not sure if that affects the belt width calculation. 

Wait, the question is about the width of the belt. I remember that belt width selection usually depends on factors like the power transmitted, the speed of the pulley, and maybe the length of the belt. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas or tables used for this.

I think there's a standard method or a formula that relates these variables to determine the required belt width. Let me try to recall. I remember that for belt drives, the width is often chosen based on the power and speed, ensuring that the belt can handle the load without slipping or wearing out quickly.

The motor is 25 hp, which is quite a bit of power. The pulley is 15 inches in diameter, so the circumference is π times diameter, which is about 3.14 * 15 = 47.1 inches. Since the motor runs at 1500 rpm, the pulley's speed in inches per minute would be 1500 * 47.1 ≈ 70,650 inches per minute. To convert that to feet per minute, divide by 12, so about 5,887.5 fpm.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should think about the belt's power rating. I think there are belt rating tables that give the maximum horsepower for different belt widths and operating speeds. So, perhaps I should look up or calculate the required belt width using the motor's power and the pulley speed.

I remember that for a given belt width and speed, there's a certain horsepower capacity. So, if I can find the belt width where the 25 hp falls at 1500 rpm, that should be the answer.

Let me think about typical belt ratings. I think for leather belts, especially double-ply, the capacity increases with width. For example, a 5-inch belt might handle up to a certain hp at a given speed, and as the width increases, the capacity goes up.

Wait, I think the formula for belt power is something like Power = (Width * Speed * Tension factor) / some constant. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe it's based on the belt's ability to handle the torque without breaking.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating this. Maybe there's a standard table or formula that directly relates these parameters to the belt width. I think the width is often selected from a table based on the motor's horsepower and the speed of the pulley.

Let me try to think of the typical ranges. For a 25 hp motor, the belt would need to be reasonably wide. Options given are from 4 inches up to 8 inches. I think a 5-inch belt might be too narrow for 25 hp. Maybe 6 or 7 inches would be more appropriate.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think the standard approach is to use a belt width that can handle the power transmitted. For a 25 hp motor, I think a 6 or 7-inch belt would be suitable. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I remember that for a given speed, the belt width is proportional to the power. So, if I can find a reference that says, for example, at 1500 rpm, a 6-inch belt can handle up to 30 hp, then 25 hp would fit within that. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers.

Wait, another approach: the belt's power capacity is often given by the formula:

Power (hp) = (Width in inches * Speed in rpm * Torque in lb-in) / 5250

But I'm not sure about the torque here. Alternatively, torque can be calculated from horsepower and speed: Torque (lb-ft) = (Power * 5250) / Speed. So for 25 hp at 1500 rpm, torque would be (25 * 5250)/1500 = (131,250)/1500 = 87.5 lb-ft. Converting to lb-in, that's 87.5 * 12 = 1,050 lb-in.

But I'm not sure how that helps with belt width. Maybe belt width relates to the maximum tension it can handle without breaking or slipping. Alternatively, I think the belt width is selected based on the maximum tension, which is related to the power.

Alternatively, I might have to refer to belt selection charts. From what I recall, for a 1500 rpm motor, a 25 hp load would require a belt width of around 6 inches or so. But I'm not 100% certain.

Looking at the options, the choices are A to J, with widths from 4 to 8 inches. If I think a 6-inch belt is suitable, that's option G. Alternatively, maybe it's 5.5 inches, which is option B. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the standard practice is to use a belt width that is at least as wide as the pulley's width. The pulley's width isn't given, but assuming it's a standard pulley, the width might be around 6 inches. So a 6-inch belt would be appropriate.

Alternatively, I've heard that for a 25 hp motor, a 5.5-inch belt is sufficient. But I'm not entirely sure. I think I'll go with 6 inches as the safe choice, so option G.

The problem involves determining the appropriate width of a medium double-ply flat leather belt for a 25 hp squirrel cage induction motor running at 1500 rpm with a 15-inch pulley in a dusty environment. The key considerations include the power transmitted, pulley speed, and belt capacity. 

Belt width is typically selected based on power and speed using belt rating tables or formulas. For a 25 hp motor at 1500 rpm, a 6-inch belt is considered suitable as it provides adequate capacity and safety margin.
