Okay, so I need to figure out how many spikes are on the Statue of Liberty's crown. Let me think about what I remember about the Statue of Liberty. I know it's a big statue in New York Harbor, right? It was a gift from France, I think. The statue is of a woman holding a torch and a tablet with some words on it. But I'm not sure about the details of the crown.

Wait, the question is specifically about the spikes on the crown. I remember that the crown has these points or rays coming out from the top. How many are there? I think it's more than five, maybe around seven or so. Let me try to visualize it. The statue's design is by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, I believe. He was inspired by various sources, maybe Egyptian architecture because of the headdress style.

I recall that the crown has something to do with the number 7, perhaps seven rays or spikes. Each spike might represent something, maybe the original thirteen colonies or something else, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it could be that there are seven because that's a common number in many designs, symbolizing unity or something.

Wait, another thought: I think each spike is actually a representation of the sun's rays, and there are seven in total. That number seven might correspond to the seven original American colonies, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's more about the number of points on a star. Alternatively, perhaps it's twelve because the statue's base is related to twelve, but I'm not certain.

I should try to recall any historical facts or descriptions. I remember that the statue's crown has multiple rays, but the exact number is a bit fuzzy. Maybe looking at pictures would help, but since I can't do that, I'll have to rely on memory. I think it's seven, but I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, could it be thirteen? That would make sense because there are thirteen original colonies, but I'm not sure if that's the case with the statue's crown.

Wait, another angle: the Statue of Liberty's crown has seven rays, each of which is a symbol of the broken chain, representing freedom. Or maybe each spike is a representation of the sun's rays, with seven being a common number in art for such symbols. I think I've heard that the crown has seven spikes, so the answer is probably C: seven.
