Okay, so I've got this question about amortization expense related to a copyright that Corbet Co. purchased. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, Corbet bought a copyright for $20,000. The legal life is the author's life plus 50 years. But Corbet expects to sell the book for five years. I'm trying to remember how amortization works for copyrights.

Wait, I think amortization is for intangible assets, right? So like, you spread the cost over the useful life of the asset. But the tricky part here is that the legal life is longer than the expected useful life. So which one do we use for amortization?

I remember that when the useful life is shorter than the legal life, you go with the useful life. Because the company can only use it for five years, even though the copyright lasts longer. So the amortization period would be five years.

So the cost is $20,000, and it's amortized over five years. That means each year's expense would be 20,000 divided by 5. Let me do that: 20,000 รท 5 equals $4,000 per year.

Wait, but wait a second. The question asks for the amount at the end of the current year. So since it's near the beginning, they just purchased it. Would they amortize the entire year's expense or just a portion?

I think so. Because the purchase was at the beginning, so for the entire year, they'd have one full year of amortization. So the expense would be $4,000.

Looking at the options, H is $4,000. So the answer should be H.

Corbet Co. purchased a copyright for $20,000 with a legal life longer than the expected useful life of five years. Amortization is based on the useful life, so $20,000 รท 5 = $4,000 per year. Since the purchase was at the beginning of the year, the full year's amortization is recorded. 

Answer: H
