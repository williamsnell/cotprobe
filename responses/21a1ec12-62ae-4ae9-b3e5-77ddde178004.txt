Question:

A woman leased a condo from the owner for a period of one year. After six months, the owner gave the woman a written option to purchase the condo for $100,000 before the expiration of the lease. With the owner's approval, the woman spent $10,000 to have the kitchen remodeled to her personal specifications. One month before the end of the lease, the owner notified the woman that he was revoking the option to purchase the condo. One week later, the woman delivered a written notice of acceptance of the option, but the owner refused to sell. If the woman initiates suit for breach of contract, which of the following is her strongest argument that an enforceable contract was formed between her and the owner?

Options:

A: After the woman paid to have the kitchen remodeled, an option contract resulted, because the owner knew the woman was relying on the offer to her detriment.
B: Because the woman had indicated her intention to stay by remodeling the kitchen, the owner cannot revoke the option to purchase.
C: Because the owner was a merchant, the written offer was irrevocable for a period not exceeding three months.
D: Because the owner's offer invited a return promise as acceptance, the woman manifested her intent to accept by remodeling the kitchen.
E: Because the woman had started using the condo as her own by remodeling it, this signified her acceptance of the purchase option.
F: Because the woman had lived in the condo for more than half the lease period, she has the right to purchase the property.
G: Because the woman had until the expiration of the lease to accept the offer, the owner's revocation would be ineffective.
H: Because the owner had given written option to purchase the condo, the owner cannot revoke it unilaterally.
I: Because the woman had spent a significant amount on remodeling the kitchen, she had vested interest in the property thus forming an enforceable contract.
J: Because the woman had received written approval from the owner for remodeling, this constituted as acceptance of the purchase option.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically about options to purchase property. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is: A woman leased a condo for a year. After six months, the owner gave her a written option to buy the condo for $100k. The woman then, with the owner's approval, spent $10k remodeling the kitchen. One month before the lease ends, the owner tells her he's revoking the option. A week later, she sends a written notice accepting the option, but the owner refuses to sell. Now she's suing for breach, and we need to figure out her strongest argument.

First, I need to recall what an option to purchase is. An option is a contract where the owner gives the lessee the right to buy the property at a set price within a certain time. It's different from a lease because it's a separate agreement. Importantly, an option is binding and can be irrevocable under certain conditions.

Looking at the options, the key issue is whether the option was revocable or not. The owner tried to revoke it, but the woman is claiming there's a contract. So, which options make the most sense?

Option A says that after remodeling, an option contract resulted because the owner knew she was relying on it to her detriment. But wait, the option was already given. The remodeling is a separate issue. So maybe this is about promissory estoppel, but I'm not sure if that's the strongest argument here.

Option B suggests that because she remodeled, indicating intent to stay, the owner can't revoke. But the option's revocability usually depends on whether it's an option contract or not. If it's an option, it's typically irrevocable. But if it's an offer, the owner can revoke unless she accepted.

Option C says because the owner is a merchant, the offer is irrevocable for up to three months under the UCC. But wait, real estate is typically excluded from the UCC, so this might not apply. So maybe C isn't the right answer.

Option D claims that the owner's offer invited a return promise as acceptance, so remodeling shows intent. But I'm not sure how that ties into forming a contract. An option is usually a unilateral contract; the offer is to buy, and the consideration is the payment for the option.

Option E says remodeling showed acceptance. But acceptance of an option is typically by a clear statement, not by actions like remodeling. So E might not be correct.

Option F argues she's lived half the lease, so she has the right to buy. But that doesn't tie into the option; living longer doesn't automatically give her the right to purchase unless specified.

Option G states that since she had until the lease end to accept, revocation is ineffective. But the owner revoked a month before the lease ended, so she still had time. But whether the revocation is valid depends on whether the option is irrevocable. If the option is still open, revocation wouldn't be allowed.

Option H says the owner can't revoke a written option unilaterally. That sounds familiar. In contract law, once an option is given in writing and supported by consideration, it's typically irrevocable. So if the option was properly formed, the owner can't revoke it.

Option I claims her remodeling gave her a vested interest, forming a contract. But I'm not sure if remodeling alone creates a contract. It might show reliance, but not necessarily form a contract.

Option J suggests that her remodeling approval is acceptance. But I think acceptance needs to be a clear statement, not just remodeling. So J might not be correct.

So the strongest argument would likely be H: the owner can't revoke the written option unilaterally because once an option is given, it's irrevocable unless there's a specific clause allowing revocation. The woman paid consideration (maybe for the option, but in this case, she had to pay $10k for remodeling, but the option itself was a separate contract). Alternatively, if the option was supported by consideration, it's binding.

Wait, but in the scenario, the owner gave her an option, which is a contract. She then accepted by remodeling? Or did she pay for the option? The question says she paid $10k to remodel the kitchen, which was after the option was given. So the option was a separate contract, and the remodeling is a separate action. Therefore, the option itself is binding, so the owner can't revoke it. So H would be the correct answer because the option was written and therefore irrevocable without her consent.

Alternatively, A suggests that because she relied on the option, there's an enforceable contract. But that's more about promissory estoppel, which may not be as strong as the option being irrevocable by law.

So I think H is the best answer.

The strongest argument is that the written option to purchase is irrevocable, as options are typically binding and cannot be revoked unilaterally once given. 

Answer: H
