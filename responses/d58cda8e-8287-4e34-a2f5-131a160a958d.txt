Okay, so I have this question here about BCD digits and how many bits are needed to store one. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my computer science, but I'll try to think it through.

First, what's BCD? BCD stands for Binary-Coded Decimal. I remember it's a way to represent decimal numbers in binary. Each digit in the decimal number is converted into a binary form. So, for example, the number 123 would be broken down into 1, 2, and 3, each converted separately.

Wait, each digit is from 0 to 9, right? So each digit needs to represent 10 possible values. Now, how many bits are needed to represent 10 distinct values? Well, I know that with binary, each bit doubles the number of possible values. Let's see, 2 bits can represent 4 values (00, 01, 10, 11), which isn't enough because we need 10. 3 bits can go up to 8 values (000 to 111), which is still not enough. Wait, no, wait a secondâ€”3 bits give 8 different combinations, which is less than 10. So 3 bits can't represent all 10 digits. Hmm, so maybe I'm wrong here.

Wait, no, actually, wait. For each decimal digit, BCD uses 4 bits. Oh, right! Because each digit can be 0-9, and 4 bits can represent 16 different values, which is more than enough. So each BCD digit is stored in 4 bits. That makes sense because I've heard that BCD encoding uses 4 bits per digit. So for example, the digit 5 would be 0101 in binary.

Wait, but why 4 bits? I thought maybe 3 bits would suffice since 3 bits can go up to 7, but wait, 7 is less than 9. So 3 bits can only go up to 7, which isn't enough for 8,9. So 4 bits are needed because 4 bits can go up to 15, which covers 0-9. So each BCD digit is 4 bits.

Looking back at the options, option F is 4. So the answer should be F.

The question asks how many bits are required to store one BCD digit. BCD stands for Binary-Coded Decimal, where each decimal digit (0-9) is represented in binary. Since each digit must represent 10 possible values, 3 bits are insufficient as they can only represent 8 values (0-7). Therefore, 4 bits are used to cover all 10 values (0-9), making option F the correct answer.

Answer: F
