Okay, so I've got this question about how many water molecules are in a human head. The options are A through J, each with different exponents. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure, but let's try to think this through.

First, I remember that the human body is mostly made up of water. I think it's like 60% or something like that. So, the head would have a significant portion of water. But how much exactly?

I need to find the mass of the average human head and then figure out how many water molecules that would correspond to. Wait, but do I know the average mass of a human head? I'm not sure, but maybe I can estimate it.

Let me think, the average human body weight is around 70 kg. The head is a part of that, maybe about 10-15%? So let's say an average of 7 kg. That seems reasonable because the head includes the skull, brain, muscles, etc. So if the total body is 70 kg, head might be 7 kg, making 10% of body weight.

Assuming the head is 7 kg, and about 60% of that is water, so 0.6 * 7 kg = 4.2 kg of water. That's 4.2 kilograms of water in the head.

Now, the next step is to find out how many water molecules are in 4.2 kg of water. I know that the molar mass of water (H₂O) is approximately 18 grams per mole. So, 18 g/mol is the same as 0.018 kg/mol.

To find the number of moles in 4.2 kg of water, I divide the mass by the molar mass: 4.2 kg / 0.018 kg/mol = 233.33... moles. That's roughly 233 moles.

Each mole of water has Avogadro's number of molecules, which is about 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol.

So, the total number of water molecules is 233 moles * 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol. Let's calculate that.

233 * 6.022e23 = approximately 1.404e26 molecules. Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one is H: 8e26 or J: 8e29. Hmm, wait, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my estimation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 4.2 kg divided by 0.018 kg/mol is indeed 233.333... moles. Then 233.333 * 6.022e23 is about 1.404e26. That's 1.4 x 10^26.

But none of the options have 1e26. The options are 8e21, 8e22, etc. Oh wait, perhaps my initial assumption about the mass of the head is too high. Let me think again.

Maybe the head is not 10% of the body weight. Let me check some sources. Wait, I can't check, but I think the brain is about 2% of body weight. So the head would be more than that, maybe around 7-8% of the body. Let's say 7 kg for a 70 kg person, so that's 10%. Alternatively, perhaps it's 5 kg, making it about 7% of body weight.

Wait, another approach: the average human head's weight is about 3.5 kg for a 70 kg person, so that's 5%. Let me recalculate with 3.5 kg.

So, 3.5 kg of head, 60% water: 2.1 kg of water.

2.1 kg / 0.018 kg/mol = 116.666... moles.

116.666 * 6.022e23 = approximately 7.03e25 molecules, which is close to 7e25. Hmm, but the options are 8e25, which is option A: 8e25.

Wait, but 7e25 is close to 8e25. Maybe I underestimated the mass. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was that the head is about 14% of body weight, so 9.8 kg, leading to more water. Let me try that.

9.8 kg head, 60% water: 5.88 kg.

5.88 kg / 0.018 kg/mol = 326.666... moles.

326.666 * 6.022e23 = approx 1.97e26, which is about 2e26. But the options don't have that. The closest is H:8e26, which is higher.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. Maybe the question is approximating the number of water molecules in the entire body and then scaling down for the head.

I've heard before that the number of water molecules in the human body is roughly 1e25 per gram, but wait, that can't be right because 1e25 per gram would mean 7e28 for 70 kg, but that's way too high.

Wait, let's think differently. The molar mass is 18g/mol, and each mole has 6e23 molecules. So per gram, it's 6e23 / 18 ≈ 3.3e22 molecules per gram.

So, 1 gram of water has about 3.3e22 molecules. Therefore, 4.2 kg is 4200 grams, so 4200 * 3.3e22 ≈ 1.386e26 molecules, which is about 1.4e26, matching my earlier calculation.

But the options don't have 1e26. Wait, looking back, the options are A:8e25, B:8e23, etc. So 1.4e26 is approximately 1.4e26, but none of the options match. The closest is A:8e25, which is smaller, or H:8e26, which is larger.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the percentage of water in the head is different. Maybe it's not 60% but more or less. I think the brain is about 75% water, but the entire head might be a bit less, maybe 70% or so.

So, if the head is 7 kg, and 70% water, that's 4.9 kg.

4.9 kg / 0.018 kg/mol = 272.22 moles.

272.22 * 6.022e23 ≈ 1.638e26 molecules, which is about 1.6e26. Still, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using an approximate value. Maybe 1e26 is roughly 10^26, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking at the options, H is 8e26, which is higher, and A is 8e25, which is lower.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial mass of the head. Let me look for an average head weight. Oh, I think the average human head weighs about 3.5 kg, so 3.5 kg is 3.5 kg. 60% water: 2.1 kg.

2.1 kg / 0.018 kg/mol = 116.666... moles.

116.666 * 6.022e23 ≈ 7.03e25 molecules, which is 7e25. The closest option is A:8e25.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the average person isn't 70 kg. Maybe an average person is 60 kg. So, 10% of 60 kg is 6 kg. 60% of 6 kg is 3.6 kg.

3.6 kg / 0.018 kg/mol = 200 moles.

200 * 6.022e23 = 1.204e26, which is still around 1.2e26.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is 8e25, which is option A.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done with a different approximation. Let me try using 65% water in the head instead of 60%.

3.5 kg head, 65% water: 2.275 kg.

2.275 kg / 0.018 kg/mol ≈ 126.39 moles.

126.39 * 6.022e23 ≈ 7.62e25, which is about 7.6e25, still closer to 8e25.

So, perhaps the correct answer is A:8e25.

To determine the number of water molecules in a human head, we start by estimating the mass of the head and the percentage of water it contains. Assuming the average human body weight is 70 kg, the head is approximately 10% of this, or 7 kg. If 60% of the head's mass is water, this amounts to 4.2 kg of water.

The molar mass of water (H₂O) is 18 g/mol. Converting 4.2 kg to grams gives 4200 g. Dividing this by the molar mass (4200 g / 18 g/mol ≈ 233.33 moles) and multiplying by Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10²³ molecules/mol) yields approximately 1.4 × 10²⁶ water molecules.

Adjusting for variations in head mass and water percentage, the closest option to this estimate is **A: 8 × 10²⁵**, which aligns with the approximations made throughout the calculation.
