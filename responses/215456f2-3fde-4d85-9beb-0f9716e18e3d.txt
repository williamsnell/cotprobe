Okay, so I have this probability problem here. It says that X and Y are independent random variables with normal distributions. X is N(5,16), which I think means it has a mean of 5 and a variance of 16. Y is N(6,9), so mean 6 and variance 9. The question is asking for P(X > Y), which is the same as P(X - Y > 0). I need to calculate this probability and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, since X and Y are independent, I remember that the difference of two independent normal variables is also normal. So, let me define a new variable D = X - Y. Then D should follow a normal distribution too. What's the mean and variance of D?

The mean of D, E[D], is E[X] - E[Y] which is 5 - 6 = -1. Right, so the mean is -1.

Now for the variance. Since X and Y are independent, the variance of D is Var(X) + Var(Y). Wait, is that right? Because Var(X - Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) when they're independent. So Var(X) is 16 and Var(Y) is 9, so Var(D) = 16 + 9 = 25. Therefore, the standard deviation of D is the square root of 25, which is 5.

So D ~ N(-1, 25), which means it has a mean of -1 and a standard deviation of 5.

The problem is asking for P(D > 0), which is the same as P(X > Y). So I need to find the probability that a normal variable with mean -1 and SD 5 is greater than 0.

To find this probability, I can standardize D. Let me compute the Z-score for D = 0.

Z = (D - μ) / σ = (0 - (-1)) / 5 = 1/5 = 0.2.

So P(D > 0) = P(Z > 0.2), where Z is a standard normal variable. I need to find the area under the standard normal curve to the right of 0.2.

I remember that standard normal tables give the area to the left of a Z-score. So P(Z < 0.2) is the value from the table, and P(Z > 0.2) is 1 minus that value.

Looking up Z = 0.2 in the standard normal table. Let me think, the Z-table for 0.2 is about 0.5793. So P(Z < 0.2) = 0.5793.

Therefore, P(Z > 0.2) = 1 - 0.5793 = 0.4207.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Some tables might give slightly different values due to rounding. Alternatively, I can use the symmetry or other properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the probability being equal to 1 - Φ(0.2), where Φ is the CDF of the standard normal. Φ(0.2) is approximately 0.5793, so 1 - 0.5793 is indeed 0.4207.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.4207. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the mean or variance. X has mean 5, Y has mean 6, so D = X - Y has mean 5 - 6 = -1. Variances add up because of independence: 16 + 9 = 25, so SD is 5. Yes, that's correct.

Then, when I standardize, 0 is (0 - (-1))/5 = 1/5 = 0.2. So Z = 0.2, and the area to the right is 0.4207. Yep, that makes sense. So option F is the answer.

The problem involves finding \( P(X > Y) \) where \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent normal variables with \( X \sim N(5, 16) \) and \( Y \sim N(6, 9) \). By defining \( D = X - Y \), \( D \) follows a normal distribution with mean \( -1 \) and variance \( 25 \) (standard deviation \( 5 \)). Calculating the Z-score for \( D = 0 \) gives \( Z = 0.2 \), leading to \( P(D > 0) = 1 - 0.5793 = 0.4207 \).
