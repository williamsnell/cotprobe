Okay, so I've got this problem about rolling two dice and calculating the expected gain or loss per game. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit nervous because probability can sometimes trip me up, but I'll take it slow.

First, the problem says that two dice are rolled simultaneously. If both dice show a 6, the player wins $20. Otherwise, the player loses the game. It costs $2.00 to play. I need to find the expected gain or loss per game.

Hmm, expected value, right? I remember that expected value is like the average outcome if you were to play the game many times. So I need to calculate the probability of winning and losing, then multiply those by their respective payouts, subtract the cost, and see what the average outcome is.

Let me break it down. When rolling two dice, each die has 6 sides, so the total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 = 36. That makes sense because for each roll of the first die, the second die can land on any of 6 numbers. So 36 possible outcomes in total.

Now, the winning condition is both dice showing 6. How many ways can that happen? Well, only one way: the first die is 6 and the second die is 6. So the probability of both dice being 6 is 1 out of 36. So P(win) = 1/36.

Conversely, the probability of losing is all the other outcomes. Since there are 36 total and only one winning, that's 35 losing outcomes. So P(lose) = 35/36.

Wait, but the problem says "otherwise the player loses the game." So the payout for winning is $20, but what's the loss? Oh, wait, the player pays $2 to play, so if they lose, they lose that $2. Alternatively, maybe the loss is more than that. Wait, no, the cost is a flat $2 to play, so regardless of losing, the player is out $2. Or is it that they lose the $2 if they don't win? Hmm, let me read the problem again.

It says, "if both dice show 6, then the player wins $20; otherwise the player loses the game." So if they don't get both 6s, they lose the game. But what does that mean in terms of money? I think it means they lose the $2 they paid to play, because that's the cost. Or maybe they lose more? Wait, the wording is a bit unclear.

Wait, the problem says it costs $2 to play. So the player pays $2 to play, and if they win, they gain $20. If they lose, they lose the $2 they paid. So their net gain is -$2 if they lose, and +$20 if they win.

Alternatively, perhaps the loss is more than that. Let me think. When you lose, you lose your $2. So the net gain when you lose is -$2. When you win, you gain $20, but you also paid the $2 to play, so your net gain is $20 - $2 = $18? Wait, no, maybe not. Because the $2 is the cost to play; if you win, you get $20 in addition to getting your $2 back? Or is the $2 separate from the potential winnings?

Wait, the problem says it costs $2 to play. So the $2 is the entrance fee. If you win, you get $20, so your net gain is $20 - $2 = $18. If you lose, you lose the $2.

Wait, actually, let me clarify. The way the problem is phrased: "if both dice show 6, then the player wins $20; otherwise the player loses the game." So perhaps if you lose, you lose the $2 you paid to play. So the net gain is +$20 (if you win) and -$2 (if you lose). Or maybe the $2 is part of the payout. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, no, I think the $2 is the cost to play, so when you lose, you don't get your $2 back. So your net loss is -$2. If you win, you get $20, but you paid $2 to play, so your net gain is $20 - $2 = $18. Alternatively, perhaps the $20 is the net gain, and the $2 is separate. Let me think carefully.

The problem says, "It costs $2.00 to play the game." So the player pays $2 to play, regardless of outcome. Then, if they win (both dice 6), they get $20. If they lose, they get nothing. So their net gain is: if they win, +$20 - $2 (since they paid $2 to play), so net gain is $18. If they lose, they get nothing, so net gain is -$2.

Alternatively, maybe the $20 is the total they receive, not considering the $2 cost. So their net gain would be $20 (if they win) minus the $2 they paid, which is $18. Or perhaps the $20 is in addition to getting their money back. Hmm, this is a point of confusion.

Wait, perhaps the problem is structured as: the player pays $2 to play, and then if they win, they receive $20. If they lose, they get nothing. So their net gain is:

- If they win: $20 (won) - $2 (cost) = +$18
- If they lose: -$2 (cost)

Alternatively, maybe the $20 is the net gain, and the $2 is the cost, so the net gain when winning is $20, and when losing, the net loss is $2. But I think the standard way is that the $2 is the cost, and the winnings are separate.

Wait, but let me think about how lotteries work. You pay the price to get a ticket, and if you win, you get the prize money. So the prize is in addition to getting your money back. So in this case, the player pays $2, and if they win, they get $20. So their net gain is $20 - $2 = $18. If they lose, they lose the $2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the player pays $2, and if they win, they gain $20, so net gain is +$20, but if they lose, they lose the $2. Wait, but that would make the net gain when losing -$2, and when winning +$20. Hmm, perhaps that's the correct way.

Wait, but I think the correct way is that the player pays $2 to play, so that's a sunk cost. If they win, they get $20, so their net gain is $20 - $2 = $18. If they lose, they get nothing, so their net gain is -$2.

Wait, no, because the $2 is the cost to play, which you pay regardless of outcome. So the net gain is:

- If you win: $20 (won) - $2 (paid) = +$18
- If you lose: -$2 (paid) 

So the expected value would be (Probability of win * $18) + (Probability of lose * -$2).

Alternatively, perhaps the $20 is the net gain, and the $2 is a separate cost. So the net gain when winning is $20, and when losing, you lose the $2. So the net gains are +$20 and -$2.

Wait, but that would make the expected value higher. Let me try both approaches and see which one makes sense.

First approach:

- Win: Probability 1/36, net gain $18
- Lose: Probability 35/36, net loss $2

Expected value = (1/36)*18 + (35/36)*(-2)

Calculate that:

18 /36 = 0.5

35/36 ≈ 0.9722

So 0.5 * 18 = 9? Wait, no, wait: wait, 18 is the amount, so (1/36)*18 = 0.5

Similarly, (35/36)*(-2) ≈ (0.9722)*(-2) ≈ -1.9444

So total expected value ≈ 0.5 -1.9444 ≈ -1.4444

So about -$1.44 per game. So the expected loss is about $1.44.

Alternatively, second approach:

Net gain when winning is $20, net loss when losing is -$2.

So expected value = (1/36)*20 + (35/36)*(-2)

Which is 20/36 ≈ 0.5556

35/36*(-2) ≈ -1.9444

Sum ≈ 0.5556 -1.9444 ≈ -1.3888, which is about -$1.39.

Hmm, these are two different results. So which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps I need to model it correctly. The player pays $2 to play, so that's a cost regardless. If they win, they get $20, so their net gain is $20 - $2 = $18. If they lose, they get nothing, so their net gain is -$2.

So the first approach is correct. So the expected value is (1/36)*18 + (35/36)*(-2) ≈ 0.5 - 1.9444 ≈ -1.4444, which is about -$1.44 per game.

Looking back at the options, option A says the player will lose about $1.44. Option C says lose about $0.89, which is close to the second approach but not the first.

Wait, but why did I get two different results? Because in the first approach, the net gain when winning is $18, and in the second, it's $20. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the player pays $2 to play, and if they win, they receive $20. So their net gain is $20 - $2 = $18. If they lose, they lose the $2 they paid. So yes, the first approach is correct.

So the expected value is approximately -$1.44, which is an expected loss of about $1.44 per game.

Looking at the options, option A says the player will lose about $1.44. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Calculating (1/36)*18 = 18/36 = 0.5

(35/36)*(-2) = (-70)/36 ≈ -1.9444

Total expected value: 0.5 -1.9444 = -1.4444, which is approximately -$1.44.

So the expected loss is about $1.44 per game. So the correct answer is option A.
</think>

The expected value is calculated by multiplying the probability of each outcome by its respective net gain and summing the results. The probability of rolling two 6s is \( \frac{1}{36} \), yielding a net gain of \$18 (\$20 winnings minus the \$2 cost). The probability of losing is \( \frac{35}{36} \), resulting in a net loss of \$2. The expected value is:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{36} \times 18 \right) + \left( \frac{35}{36} \times (-2) \right) \approx -1.44
\]

This indicates an expected loss of approximately \$1.44 per game.
