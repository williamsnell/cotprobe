Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem about the thermal decomposition of a compound. Hmm, the problem says that the compound (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3 is decomposing into acetone and ethane. The reaction is in the gas phase, and it starts at 1.0 atm. The rate constant given is 0.0019 s⁻¹, and I need to find out at what time the pressure becomes 1.8 atm.

Wait, I remember that for gas-phase reactions, especially decomposition, the pressure changes because the moles of gas change. Let me think about the stoichiometry here. The reactant is one molecule, and it's breaking down into two products. Let me write the reaction:

(CH3)3COOC(CH3)3(g) → 2 (CH3)2CO(g) + C2H6(g)

Wait, no, wait. Let me count the moles. The reactant is one mole. On the product side, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which is one mole, and ethane is C2H6, another mole. So actually, the decomposition produces 2 moles of gas. So 1 mole → 2 moles. So each mole of reactant produces 2 moles of products. So the total moles increase by 1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check again. The reactant is (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3. So that's one molecule. When it decomposes, it forms two acetone molecules and one ethane molecule? Or maybe two acetone and one ethane? Wait, perhaps I should look at the formula again.

Wait, the reactant is (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3. So the formula is C7H14O2, I think. Because each (CH3)3 group is 3 CH3, so that's 3*3=9 C, but wait, no, wait. Wait, (CH3)3COO- is (CH3)3C-O-O-C(CH3)3? No, wait, the formula is (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3. So that's (CH3)3-C-O-C-(CH3)3. So each side has (CH3)3C-O-.

Wait, maybe the decomposition produces acetone and ethane. Let me see the products: acetone is (CH3)2CO, which is one molecule, and ethane is C2H6, which is another. So the reaction must be:

(CH3)3COOC(CH3)3 → 2 (CH3)2CO + C2H6?

Wait, no, that would make three products. Let me check: the reactant is one mole. On the product side, two moles of acetone and one mole of ethane would be three moles in total, right? Because 2 + 1 = 3. So from 1 mole to 3 moles. That means the total moles of gas increase by a factor of 3.

Wait, but maybe I should write the balanced equation properly. Let me think: the reactant is (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3, which is a di-tert-butyl peroxide. It decomposes into two acetone molecules and one ethane molecule. So the reaction is:

(CH3)3COOC(CH3)3 → 2 (CH3)2CO + C2H6.

Yes, that makes sense. So each mole of reactant produces two moles of acetone and one mole of ethane. So total moles of gas increase from 1 to 3, so an increase of 2 moles per mole of reactant.

Wait, no, wait. 1 mole of reactant produces 2 + 1 = 3 moles of products. So the total moles go from 1 to 3, which is an increase of 2. So for each mole of reactant that decomposes, the moles of gas increase by 2.

Now, the initial pressure is 1.0 atm. Let's denote the initial pressure as P_initial = 1.0 atm. Let’s let x be the extent of reaction in terms of moles of reactant decomposed. The total pressure at time t is what we're after, which is given as 1.8 atm.

Wait, but I think it's better to model this using the ideal gas law, since the reaction is in the gas phase. Since the volume and temperature are constant (assuming), the pressure is proportional to the total moles.

Let’s denote:

At initial time (t=0), pressure P0 = 1.0 atm, moles = n0 = 1.0 (since it's 1.0 atm, and assuming 1 mole in a container with certain volume and temp).

As the reaction proceeds, some of the reactant decomposes. Let's let x be the number of moles of reactant that have decomposed. Then, the remaining moles of reactant is (1 - x), and the moles of products are 2x (from acetone) + x (from ethane) = 3x. So total moles at time t is (1 - x) + 3x = 1 + 2x.

Wait, that's correct because each mole of reactant decomposes into 3 moles of products. So the total moles are 1 + 2x.

The pressure at time t is P(t) = P0 * (n(t)/n0) ) = P0 * (1 + 2x) because n0 =1. So P(t) = 1.0 atm * (1 + 2x) = 1 + 2x.

We're told that P(t) = 1.8 atm. So:

1 + 2x = 1.8 → 2x = 0.8 → x=0.4.

So x is 0.4 moles of reactant decomposed.

But wait, wait. Are we assuming that the reaction starts with 1.0 mole (since initial pressure is 1.0 atm, assuming same volume and temp)? Or is the initial pressure 1.0 atm for the reactant, and the products are formed from that? Hmm, perhaps I should model it using the reaction's stoichiometry correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps using the ideal gas approach with partial pressures. Let me think.

The reaction is:

A → 2 B + C

Where A is (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3, B is acetone, and C is ethane.

Let’s let the initial pressure of A be 1.0 atm, and B and C are zero.

At time t, let the pressure of A be P_A, and B be P_B, and C be P_C.

The change in pressure of A is (1.0 - P_A), because it's decomposing. For every mole of A that decomposes, it produces 2 moles of B and 1 mole of C. So the pressure of B will be 2*(1.0 - P_A), and C will be (1.0 - P_A).

Wait, no. Wait, the stoichiometry is 1 A → 2 B + 1 C. So for each mole of A that reacts, 2 moles of B and 1 mole of C are formed. So the change in pressure for B is 2*(change in A), and same for C.

Let’s denote the extent of reaction as α (fraction of A that has decomposed). So P_A = 1.0 - α.

Then, P_B = 2α, and P_C = α.

So total pressure P_total = P_A + P_B + P_C = (1.0 - α) + 2α + α = 1.0 + 2α.

We are told that P_total = 1.8 atm. So 1.0 + 2α = 1.8 → 2α = 0.8 → α = 0.4.

So α is 0.4, meaning 40% of the reactant has decomposed.

Now, the rate of reaction is given by the rate constant k. The rate law for a decomposition reaction is usually first-order, so rate = d[P]/dt = k [A].

Wait, but wait, the rate law for a unimolecular reaction (like decomposition of A) is first-order in [A]. So the rate equation is:

d[α]/dt = k (1 - α)

Wait, no, I think the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction is ln([A]₀/[A]) = kt. But since we're dealing with α as the fraction decomposed, perhaps we can express it in terms of α.

Alternatively, since [A] = [A]₀ (1 - α), where [A]₀ is the initial concentration. So the rate equation can be written as:

dα/dt = k (1 - α)

Wait, but that's not correct. Because for a first-order reaction, the rate is d[A]/dt = -k [A]. Let me correct this.

Let’s denote [A] as the concentration at time t. The initial concentration is [A]₀. The rate of decomposition is:

d[A]/dt = -k [A]

Because the reaction is first-order. The negative sign indicates that [A] is decreasing.

The solution to this differential equation is [A] = [A]₀ e^{-kt}.

The fraction decomposed, α, is (1 - ([A]/[A]₀)) ) = 1 - e^{-kt}.

Wait, but earlier we found that α = 0.4. So:

α = 1 - e^{-kt} → 0.4 = 1 - e^{-kt} → e^{-kt} = 0.6 → -kt = ln(0.6) → t = -ln(0.6)/k.

Given that k = 0.0019 s⁻¹.

So let's compute t:

ln(0.6) is approximately ln(6/10) = ln(0.6) ≈ -0.5108.

So t = - (-0.5108) / 0.0019 ≈ 0.5108 / 0.0019 ≈ 269 s.

Looking at the options, option I is 269 s. So the answer should be I.

To determine the time at which the pressure reaches 1.8 atm during the decomposition of $(\mathrm{CH}_3)_3\mathrm{COOC}(\mathrm{CH}_3)_3$, we analyze the reaction:

$$(\mathrm{CH}_3)_3\mathrm{COOC}(\mathrm{CH}_3)_3(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow 2\,(\mathrm{CH}_3)_2\mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{g}) + \mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_6(\mathrm{g}).$$

### Step 1: Stoichiometry and Pressure Relationship
The reaction shows that 1 mole of the reactant produces 3 moles of products (2 moles of acetone and 1 mole of ethane). Thus, the total moles of gas increase from 1 mole to 3 moles, leading to an increase in pressure. Let $x$ represent the moles of reactant decomposed. The total moles of gas at time $t$ are $1 + 2x$, and the pressure is proportional to the total moles:

$$P(t) = P_0 \cdot (1 + 2x),$$

where $P_0 = 1.0 \, \mathrm{atm}$. Setting $P(t) = 1.8 \, \mathrm{atm}$:

$$1.8 = 1.0 \cdot (1 + 2x) \implies 1 + 2x = 1.8 \implies 2x = 0.8 \implies x = 0.4.$$

Thus, 40% of the reactant has decomposed.

### Step 2: Integrated Rate Law
The reaction is first-order, with the rate constant $k = 0.0019 \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The fraction of reactant decomposed, $\alpha$, is related to time by:

$$\alpha = 1 - e^{-kt}.$$

Substituting $\alpha = 0.4$:

$$0.4 = 1 - e^{-0.0019t} \implies e^{-0.0019t} = 0.6 \implies -0.0019t = \ln(0.6).$$

### Step 3: Solve for Time
Calculate $\ln(0.6) \approx -0.5108$:

$$t = \frac{-\ln(0.6)}{0.0019} = \frac{0.5108}{0.0019} \approx 269 \, \mathrm{s}.$$

### Final Answer
The time required for the pressure to reach 1.8 atm is approximately **269 seconds**, corresponding to option I.
