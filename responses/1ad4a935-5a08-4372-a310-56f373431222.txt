Okay, so I have this question about factors that increase the risk of lung cancer. Let's see what the options are and think through each one. I remember that lung cancer is mostly associated with smoking, but there are other factors too. 

The options are A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

A: Saturated fat. I'm not sure, but I think saturated fats are linked more to heart disease rather than lung cancer. Maybe not a direct risk factor, but I'm not certain.

B: High fiber diet. I've heard that high fiber is good for digestion and can help with some cancers, but does it increase risk? Probably not; it might even reduce risk, so B is probably not the answer.

C: Eating citrus fruits. Citrus fruits are high in vitamin C and antioxidants, which are generally protective against diseases. So C probably doesn't increase risk.

D: Alcohol. Hmm, alcohol is definitely linked to several cancers, like liver and mouth cancers. But does it directly cause lung cancer? I'm not too sure, but I think it might increase the risk, especially when combined with smoking.

E: Lack of physical activity. I know that being sedentary can contribute to various health issues, but I'm not sure if it's a direct risk factor for lung cancer. Maybe it's more about overall health rather than a direct cause.

F: Low protein intake. Low protein might affect muscle health and recovery, but I don't recall it being a major risk factor for lung cancer. So probably not F.

G: Vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is important for bone health and has some roles in cancer prevention. Deficiency might not directly cause lung cancer, but I'm not certain if it's a risk factor.

H: Obesity. Obesity is linked to several cancers, including breast, colon, and maybe even lung. So H could be a possible answer.

I: High dose ß-carotene supplements. Wait, I remember something about beta-carotene supplements. I think that high doses can be harmful. There was a study where smokers who took beta-carotene supplements had an increased risk of lung cancer. So I might be the correct answer.

J: Drinking green tea. Green tea is packed with antioxidants and is generally considered beneficial, so it probably doesn't increase the risk. In fact, it might reduce cancer risk.

So looking back, the options that seem to increase risk are D (Alcohol), H (Obesity), and I (High dose beta-carotene supplements). But I'm trying to remember the specifics. I think alcohol does increase the risk of lung cancer, but maybe not as much as smoking. Obesity might be a factor too, but the strongest link I remember is with beta-carotene supplements, especially in smokers. So I think I is the correct answer.

The correct answer is I: High dose ß-carotene supplements, as they have been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer, particularly in smokers.
