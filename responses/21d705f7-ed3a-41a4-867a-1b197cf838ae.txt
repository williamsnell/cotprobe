<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the interest rate earned on a Treasury bill. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the question says I bought a 91-day $500,000 Treasury bill for $485,000 and held it until maturity. I need to find the interest rate I earned. Hmm, I remember that T-bills are sold at a discount and mature at face value, so the interest is the difference between what I paid and what I get at maturity.

So, the face value is $500,000, and I paid $485,000. The difference is $500,000 minus $485,000, which is $15,000. That $15,000 is the interest I earned over 91 days.

Now, to find the interest rate, I think I need to calculate the annualized rate because interest rates are usually expressed annually. But wait, how do I annualize a 91-day rate? I remember something about using a 360-day year in banking calculations, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's 365 days? I'll have to think about which one applies here.

The formula I think I should use is: 

Interest Rate = (Interest Earned / Purchase Price) * (360 / Days to Maturity)

Or maybe it's 365 instead of 360. Let me check which one is correct. I think for T-bills, they use a 360-day year for calculation purposes, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, sometimes it's based on actual days, which would be 365. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the formula for the bond yield is usually (Face Value - Purchase Price) / Purchase Price * (365 / Days). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the formula might be (Interest Earned / Purchase Price) * (360 / Days). Let me try both and see which one makes sense.

First, let's compute the interest earned, which is $15,000. The purchase price is $485,000. So, the interest rate for the period is ($15,000 / $485,000) * (360 or 365 / 91).

Let me compute both options.

Option 1: Using 360 days.

So, (15,000 / 485,000) = approximately 0.030927. Then, 360 / 91 is about 3.956. Multiply those together: 0.030927 * 3.956 ≈ 0.1223, which is about 12.23%. Looking at the options, option B is 12.5%, which is close but not exact. Is there a calculation mistake?

Wait, maybe I should compute more accurately. Let's compute 15,000 / 485,000 first.

15,000 divided by 485,000 equals approximately 0.030927835.

Then, 360 divided by 91 is approximately 3.95604396.

Multiplying those together: 0.030927835 * 3.95604396 ≈ 0.1223, which is 12.23%. Hmm, none of the options exactly match that, but option B is 12.5%, which is the closest higher figure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use 365 days.

Let me try that. 365 / 91 is approximately 4.010989.

So, 0.030927835 * 4.010989 ≈ 0.1239, which is about 12.39%. That's closer to 12.4%, but still, the options don't have that. Wait, the options have 12.5% (B) and 12% (G). Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (Interest Earned / Face Value) * (360 / Days). Let me try that. So, 15,000 / 500,000 = 0.03. Then, 360 / 91 ≈ 3.956. So, 0.03 * 3.956 ≈ 0.11868, which is about 11.87%. Looking at the options, I see option I is 11.8%, which is very close.

Wait, but I think I might have confused the formula. The correct formula for the yield on a T-bill is (Face Value - Purchase Price) / Face Value * (360 / Days). Or is it (Face Value - Purchase Price) / Purchase Price? Let me double-check.

I think it's based on the purchase price. So the formula is [(F - P)/P] * (360/days). So F is 500k, P is 485k. So (500k -485k)/485k = 15,000 /485,000 ≈ 0.030927835. Then multiply by (360/91)=3.956. So 0.030927835 * 3.956 ≈ 0.1223, which is 12.23%.

But looking at the options, 12.5% is B, and 12% is G. 12.23% is closer to 12.2%, which isn't an option. Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Let me calculate 15,000 / 485,000 exactly: that's 15,000 ÷ 485,000. Let's compute that. 485,000 goes into 15,000 how many times? 485,000 x 0.03 is 14,550. So 0.03 gives us 14,550, which is less than 15,000. The difference is 450. So 450 / 485,000 is 0.0009278. So total is 0.0309278, which is 3.09278%.

Then, 360 /91 is exactly 360 ÷ 91 ≈ 3.95604396.

Multiplying 0.0309278 * 3.95604396:

Let me compute this precisely.

0.0309278 * 3.95604396.

First, 0.03 * 3.95604396 = 0.118681319.

Then, 0.0009278 * 3.95604396 ≈ 0.003665.

Adding them together: 0.118681319 + 0.003665 ≈ 0.122346, which is about 12.2346%.

Looking at the options, B is 12.5%, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 365 days. Let me try that.

So, 365 /91. Let me compute that: 91 days is a bit less than a quarter year, which is 92 days. So 365/91 ≈4.010989.

Now, 0.0309278 *4.010989 ≈ 0.1239, which is 12.39%. Still, the closest option is B:12.5%.

Wait, but another thought: the question says "interest rate you earn." Maybe it's the simple interest rate, not annualized. Let me see. The simple interest would be (15,000 /485,000) *100 = approximately 3.09278%. But that's not one of the options, so it must be annualized.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (Interest / Purchase Price) * (365 / days). Let me compute that again.

15,000 /485,000 = 0.0309278.

365/91 ≈4.010989.

0.0309278 *4.010989 ≈0.1239, which is 12.39%. Still, the options don't have 12.39%, but B is 12.5% and I is 11.8%. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the correct formula is [(F - P)/F] * (360/days). Let's try that.

(500,000 -485,000)/500,000 = 15,000/500,000 = 0.03.

0.03 * (360/91) ≈0.03 *3.956≈0.1187, which is 11.87%. Oh, that's close to option I:11.8%.

Wait, that's conflicting with my previous calculation. So which formula is correct?

I think the correct formula for the yield on a T-bill is [(F - P)/P] * (360/days). Because the yield is based on the purchase price, not the face value. So the first calculation where I used P=485k gives me approximately 12.23%, but when I used F=500k, I get 11.87%.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because I'm not sure which formula is standard. Let me look it up in my notes. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I remember that the yield is calculated as (Face Value - Price) / Price * (360/days). So the correct formula is using the purchase price as the denominator.

So, using that, it's 15,000 /485,000 =0.0309278, times 360/91=3.956, giving 12.23%.

But in the options, I don't see 12.23%. The closest is 12.5% (B) and 12% (G). So perhaps the correct answer is 12.5%, but I'm not sure why it's not exactly matching.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to compute it as simple interest without annualizing, but that can't be because the options are all above 8%, which would make sense for annualized rates.

Wait, perhaps the days are considered as 90 days instead of 91? Let me check. If it's 90 days, then 360/90=4, so 0.0309278 *4=0.12371, which is 12.37%. Still, the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe the formula is (F - P)/P * (365/days). Let's try that.

So, 15,000 /485,000 =0.0309278.

365/91≈4.010989.

0.0309278 *4.010989≈0.1239, which is 12.39%. Again, not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (F - P)/F * (365/days). So, 15,000/500,000=0.03.

0.03 * (365/91)=0.03*4.010989≈0.12033, which is 12.03%. Still, the options don't have that.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me check the options again. The options are A:10.4, B:12.5, C:9.5, D:15, E:8.3, F:14.2, G:12, H:13, I:11.8, J:10.

So, 12.23% isn't there, but 12% is option G. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different approach.

Wait, another approach: The interest rate can be calculated using the simple interest formula: I = P * r * t, where I is interest earned ($15,000), P is principal ($485,000), r is the annual rate, and t is time in years (91/360 or 91/365).

So, solving for r:

r = I / (P * t)

If using 360 days, t=91/360=0.2527778.

So r=15,000/(485,000 *0.2527778)=15,000/(122,527.777)=≈0.1224, which is 12.24%.

If using 365 days, t=91/365≈0.249315.

r=15,000/(485,000 *0.249315)=15,000/(121,020.075)=≈0.1239, which is 12.39%.

Again, this brings me back to around 12.2-12.4%, which isn't an option. The closest higher option is B:12.5%, and the closest lower is G:12%.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the actual formula for T-bills, which is (F - P)/P * (360/days). So, 15,000/485,000=0.0309278, times 360/91≈3.956, giving 0.1223 or 12.23%. Since the options don't have that, maybe it's rounded to 12%, which is option G.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done as (15,000/500,000) * (360/91)=0.03 *3.956≈0.1187 or 11.87%, which is option I.

Wait, but that would be using F as the denominator, which I thought was incorrect. I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (F - P)/P * (360/days), which gives 12.23%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 12.5%, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me compute 15,000 /485,000 exactly.

15,000 ÷485,000 = 0.030927835.

360 ÷91=3.95604396.

So, 0.030927835 *3.95604396 = ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.03 *3.95604396 = 0.118681319.

0.000927835 *3.95604396 ≈0.003665.

Adding them: 0.118681319 +0.003665≈0.122346, which is 12.2346%.

So approximately 12.23%.

Looking back at the options, none match exactly, but B is 12.5% and G is 12%. Maybe the intended answer is B, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question might have a typo, but that's not helpful.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the simple interest rate without annualizing, but that would be 3.09%, which isn't an option. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done as (F - P)/F * (360/days). Let me try that.

(15,000/500,000)=0.03.

0.03 *3.956≈0.11868, which is 11.868%, close to option I:11.8%.

Hmm, that's another possibility. So depending on which formula we use, we get either 12.23% or 11.86%.

I think the correct formula is [(F - P)/P] * (360/days), which gives 12.23%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 12.5% (B).

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate it as (F - P)/P * (365/days), which would be 12.39%, but that's still not an option.

Wait, maybe I should check the calculation again.

15,000 /485,000 = 0.030927835.

Multiply by 360/91=3.95604396.

So 0.030927835 *3.95604396.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 0.03 *3.95604396 = 0.118681319.

Then, 0.000927835 *3.95604396.

0.0009 *3.95604396≈0.0035604.

0.000027835 *3.95604396≈0.0001098.

Adding those: 0.0035604 +0.0001098≈0.0036702.

So total is 0.118681319 +0.0036702≈0.1223515, which is 12.23515%.

So approximately 12.24%.

Again, not matching any option. The closest is B:12.5% and G:12%.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 12.5%, but I'm not sure why it's not matching exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different day count convention, like actual/actual, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that 91 days is exactly 13 weeks, so 91/365=0.249315 years.

So, r = 15,000 / (485,000 *0.249315)=15,000/(121,020.075)=0.1239 or 12.39%.

Still, it's not matching any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 12.5%, which is option B. Maybe the calculation expects us to round up to the nearest half percent.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 12%, which is option G.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The formula for the T-bill yield is:

Y = [(F - P)/P] * (360/n)

Where n is the number of days.

So, F=500k, P=485k, n=91.

So, Y= (15,000/485,000)*360/91 = (0.030927835)*(3.95604396)=0.122346 or 12.2346%.

So approximately 12.23%.

Looking at the options, the closest is B:12.5%, which is 0.27% higher. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to round to the nearest whole number, which would be 12%, option G.

But 12.23% is closer to 12% than to 12.5%. Wait, 12.23 is just 0.23 above 12, and 0.27 below 12.5. So it's actually closer to 12% than to 12.5%.

Wait, no. 12.23 is 0.23 above 12, and 0.27 below 12.5, so it's closer to 12.25, which is halfway between 12 and 12.5. So, 12.23 is just slightly closer to 12%.

But none of the options are 12.2%. So perhaps the intended answer is 12.5%, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are:

A:10.4

B:12.5

C:9.5

D:15

E:8.3

F:14.2

G:12

H:13

I:11.8

J:10

So, the closest is B:12.5 and G:12.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 12.5%, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interest is calculated as a percentage of the face value, not the purchase price. Let me try that.

So, (15,000 /500,000)*100=3%. But that's not an option. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest rate is calculated as (15,000 /485,000)*100=3.09%, which is not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the simple interest rate without annualizing, but that would be 3.09%, which isn't an option. So that can't be.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another way to approach this.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (Interest / Purchase Price) * (365 / days). So, 15,000/485,000=0.0309278. 365/91≈4.010989. So 0.0309278 *4.010989≈0.1239, which is 12.39%. Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use 360 days for the year, so 360/91=3.956. So, 0.0309278 *3.956≈12.23%.

So, I think the correct answer is approximately 12.23%, but since that's not an option, I have to choose the closest one, which is B:12.5% or G:12%.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is 12.5%, given that it's a common approximation. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (F - P)/F * (365/days). Let me compute that.

(15,000/500,000)=0.03.

0.03 * (365/91)=0.03*4.010989≈0.12033, which is 12.03%. Closer to 12%, option G.

So, perhaps the answer is G:12%.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a resource or formula to confirm.

After some quick research in my notes, I find that the T-bill yield is calculated as:

Yield = [(F - P)/P] * (360/n)

Where n is the number of days to maturity.

So, using that, the calculation is:

(15,000 /485,000) * (360/91) = 0.0309278 *3.95604396 ≈12.23%.

Since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is 12.5%, option B.

But I'm still not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to ignore the 360-day year and use 365, which would give approximately 12.39%, but that's still not an option.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done as (15,000 /485,000) * (365/91)=0.0309278 *4.010989≈12.39%, which is approximately 12.4%, but again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 12%, option G, considering rounding down.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the standard formula, the answer should be around 12.23%, but since that's not an option, I'll have to choose the closest one, which is B:12.5%.
</think>

The interest rate is calculated using the formula for the yield on a Treasury bill: 

\[
\text{Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Face Value} - \text{Purchase Price}}{\text{Purchase Price}} \right) \times \left( \frac{360}{\text{Days to Maturity}} \right)
\]

Here, the face value is $500,000, the purchase price is $485,000, and the days to maturity are 91. The interest earned is $15,000. Plugging these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Yield} = \left( \frac{15,000}{485,000} \right) \times \left( \frac{360}{91} \right) \approx 0.0309278 \times 3.95604396 \approx 0.1223 \text{ or } 12.23\%
\]

Since 12.23% is not an exact match to any option, the closest higher option is **B: 12.5%**.

Answer: B
