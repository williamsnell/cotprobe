Okay, so I'm trying to solve this fluid dynamics problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that an ideal fluid flows through a pipe with radius Q and flow speed V. Then the pipe splits into three separate paths, each with radius Q/2. I need to find the flow speed through each of these paths.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with fluid flow and pipe changes, the principle of continuity applies. The continuity equation states that the mass flow rate remains constant in an ideal fluid (incompressible and inviscid). So the mass flow rate before splitting should equal the total mass flow rate after splitting.

The mass flow rate (let's call it dm/dt) is given by the product of the cross-sectional area (A) and the flow speed (v) multiplied by the density (ρ). Since the fluid is ideal and incompressible, the density remains constant, so I can ignore it for now and focus on the area and velocity.

The initial pipe has radius Q. The cross-sectional area A_initial is πQ². The flow speed is V, so the initial mass flow rate is A_initial * V = πQ² * V.

After splitting, there are three pipes, each with radius Q/2. The area of each smaller pipe would be π(Q/2)². Let me compute that: π*(Q²/4) = πQ²/4. 

Since there are three such pipes, the total area after splitting is 3 * (πQ²/4) = (3πQ²)/4.

Now, applying the continuity equation, the total mass flow rate before and after must be the same. So,

A_initial * V = Total A_after * v'

Where v' is the flow speed in each of the three paths. Plugging in the areas,

πQ² * V = (3πQ²/4) * v'

I can cancel out πQ² from both sides since they are non-zero:

V = (3/4) * v'

Now, solving for v', I multiply both sides by 4/3:

v' = V * (4/3) = (4/3) V.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 4/3 V, which matches this result. So each of the three paths has a flow speed of 4/3 times V.

But wait a second, that seems counterintuitive. When the pipe splits, the area decreases for each branch, which should cause the speed to increase, right? Because the same mass has to go through a smaller area, so speed must go up. Since each branch is Q/2 in radius, the area is a quarter of the original. But since there are three branches, each has 1/3 of the original area? No, wait, no: the area per branch is (Q/2)^2 = Q²/4. The total area after splitting is 3*(Q²/4) = 3Q²/4. The original area is Q², so the total after is 3/4 of the original. So the velocity must increase to maintain the same flow rate. So the calculation makes sense.

Wait, let me double-check. The initial area is A1 = πQ². After splitting, each small area A2 = π(Q/2)² = πQ²/4. Since there are three, total A2_total = 3*(πQ²/4) = 3πQ²/4. So A2_total is (3/4) A1. So A_initial * V = A2_total * v'. So v' = (A_initial / A2_total) * V = (1 / (3/4)) V = (4/3) V. Yep, that's correct.

So each path has a flow speed of 4/3 V, which is option A.

The flow speed through each of the three paths after the pipe splits is (4/3)V.
