Okay, so I have this probability problem here. It says that if four points are picked independently at random inside triangle ABC, what's the probability that none of them lies inside the triangle formed by the other three? The options are from A to J, with various decimal probabilities.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on geometric probability, but let me try to think this through. So, first, I need to understand the problem. We have four points picked randomly inside a triangle. We want the probability that none of these four points is inside the triangle formed by the other three. That means, for each point, the other three should form a triangle that doesn't contain it. Alternatively, all four points must lie such that each is outside the triangle formed by the other three.

Wait, actually, that might not be possible because if you have three points, they form a triangle. The fourth point either lies inside or outside of that triangle. So, if all four points are such that any three don't enclose the fourth, that might be tricky. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of inclusion-exclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps each point has a certain probability of being outside the triangle formed by the other three. If the points are picked independently, maybe the probability for each point to be outside the others' triangle is the same, and then we can multiply them? But wait, no, because the positions are dependent; the triangle formed by the other three affects where the fourth can be.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is similar to the probability that four points are in convex position, but in a triangle. Wait, but in a triangle, any four points would have at least one point inside the convex hull of the others, right?

Wait, no. Wait, in a triangle, if you pick four points, it's possible that all four are on the edges or vertices, but since they're inside, maybe all four form a convex quadrilateral? Wait, no, because any three points in a triangle can form a smaller triangle, and the fourth point could be outside of that. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the probability that a single point lies inside the triangle formed by the other three. Then, the probability that none of the four points lie inside the triangle formed by the other three would be 1 minus the probability that at least one point lies inside the triangle formed by the other three.

But calculating the probability that at least one lies inside seems complicated. Maybe it's easier to compute the probability that a particular point is inside the triangle formed by the other three, then use inclusion-exclusion for four points.

Wait, but inclusion-exclusion for four events can get messy. Alternatively, maybe each point has the same probability p of being inside the triangle formed by the other three, and since the points are independent, the probability that none are inside would be (1-p)^4. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the positions are dependent.

Wait, perhaps I should find the probability that a single point is inside the triangle formed by the other three. Let's denote this probability as p for a single point. Then, since the four points are independent, the probability that none of them is inside the triangle formed by the other three would be (1-p)^4? Wait, but no, because the events are not independent. For example, if one point is inside the triangle formed by the other three, that affects the probabilities of the others. So, maybe that approach isn't valid.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the probability that all four points are such that none is inside the convex hull of the other three. But in a triangle, the convex hull of three points is a triangle, and the fourth point is inside this triangle. Wait, but that can't be, because if you have four points in a triangle, at least one must be inside the convex hull of the others. Wait, is that true?

Wait, no. For example, imagine four points all lying on the edges of the triangle, but not forming a convex quadrilateral. Wait, but in a triangle, any three points form a convex triangle, and the fourth point could be on an edge, which would lie on the convex hull of the other three. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for known results or think about expected values. But I don't remember any formula off the top of my head.

Wait, another approach: the problem is similar to the probability that four points are in general position, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find the probability that a single point is inside the triangle formed by the other three. Let's focus on that. Suppose we have three points A, B, C, and a fourth point D. What's the probability that D is inside triangle ABC? Wait, but in our case, all points are picked inside the same triangle. So, the probability that D is inside the triangle formed by A, B, C is the same as the expected area of the triangle ABC divided by the area of the original triangle. Wait, but no, that's not correct because the points are random.

Wait, actually, for three random points inside a triangle, the expected area of the triangle they form is known, but I'm not sure about the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the probability that a fourth point lies inside the triangle formed by three others is equal to the expected value of the area of the triangle formed by three random points divided by the area of the original triangle.

Wait, but I think the expected area of a random triangle inside a given triangle is 1/7 of the original area. So, if the original triangle has area 1, the expected area of the random triangle is 1/7. Therefore, the probability that a fourth point lies inside this random triangle would be the expected area, which is 1/7. So, p = 1/7 for a single point.

Wait, but wait, that might not be accurate. I think the expected area of the convex hull of three random points in a triangle is 1/7 of the original area. So, the expected area is 1/7. Therefore, the probability that a fourth point is inside this triangle is 1/7.

Wait, but then the probability that the fourth point is inside the triangle formed by the first three is 1/7. So, for four points, the probability that a particular one is inside the triangle formed by the other three is 1/7.

But since we have four points, we might need to consider all four possibilities, i.e., any of the four points could be inside the triangle formed by the other three. So, using inclusion-exclusion, the probability that at least one point is inside the triangle formed by the other three is 4*(1/7) - 6*(probability that two points are inside each other's triangles) + ... but this might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability that none of the four points lies inside the triangle formed by the other three is equal to the probability that all four points are such that each is outside the triangle formed by the other three. That might be equivalent to all four points being on the convex hull of the four points. But in a triangle, the convex hull of four points can be a quadrilateral, but only if all four are on the edges or something.

Wait, no. Wait, the convex hull of four points in a triangle can be a triangle if one point is inside the triangle formed by the other three. So, if none of the four points is inside the triangle formed by the other three, then all four points must lie on the convex hull, which would form a quadrilateral. But in a triangle, it's impossible for four points to all lie on the convex hull, because any three points can form a triangle, and the fourth point can't lie outside of that without being on the edge of the original triangle. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of affine geometry. In a triangle, any four points must have at least one point inside the convex hull of the other three. So, the probability that none of them lies inside the triangle formed by the other three is zero. But that can't be, because the options don't have zero. Wait, but the options include 0.125, 0.6667, etc.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about that. Maybe it's possible for four points in a triangle to have none inside the others' convex hull. For example, if all four points lie on the edges of the triangle, then each point is on the edge, and maybe they form a convex quadrilateral, so none is inside the convex hull of the other three.

Wait, but in reality, four points inside a triangle can't all lie on the convex hull because the convex hull of four points in a triangle would require that three of them form a triangle, and the fourth lies on the edge, but that would make the fourth point lie on the convex hull of the other three, not inside.

Wait, no, if four points are placed such that each is on a different edge of the triangle, perhaps. Wait, but a triangle has three edges, so you can't have four points each on a different edge. So, at least two points would be on the same edge. Hmm.

Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the initial idea. If the probability that a single point is inside the triangle formed by the other three is 1/7, then the probability that none of the four points is inside the triangle formed by the other three is (6/7)^4, but that would be if each event is independent, which they're not. So, that approach is flawed.

Alternatively, the problem might be symmetric, and the probability that none is inside is 4 * (probability that one specific point is inside, and the others are not). But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually easier. The question is about four points, and the condition is that no one lies inside the triangle formed by the other three. So, for each point, it's outside the triangle formed by the other three. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that all four points are such that each is outside the triangle formed by the other three.

Wait, but how do you compute that? Maybe for each point, the probability that it's outside the triangle formed by the other three is 6/7, since the expected area is 1/7, so the probability that a point is inside is 1/7, and outside is 6/7. But again, this is assuming independence, which they're not.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the probability that a single point is inside the triangle formed by the other three is 1/7, as I thought earlier. So, the probability that none of the four points is inside the triangle formed by the other three is 1 - 4*(1/7) + ... but inclusion-exclusion gets complicated. Let me think.

The inclusion-exclusion formula for four events A, B, C, D where A is the event that point 1 is inside the triangle formed by the other three, etc., would be:

P(A ∨ B ∨ C ∨ D) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) + P(D) - P(A ∧ B) - P(A ∧ C) - ... + P(A ∧ B ∧ C) + ... - P(A ∧ B ∧ C ∧ D))

But this is getting too complex. Maybe an approximate approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is known. I recall that in some similar problems, the probability is 1/8, which is 0.125, but that's option A. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: in a triangle, the probability that a random point lies inside a random triangle formed by three other points is 1/7. So, the expected number of points inside the triangle formed by the other three is 4*(1/7) = 4/7. But that's expected value, not probability.

Wait, but perhaps the probability that none of them lie inside is e^{-4/7}, but that's an approximation using Poisson distribution, which may not be accurate here.

Alternatively, perhaps each point has a 1/7 chance of being inside, so the probability that none are inside is (6/7)^4 ≈ 0.56. But that's not one of the options. Wait, 6/7 is approximately 0.857, and (0.857)^4 ≈ 0.56, which is close to 0.56, but the options don't have that. So, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. If the probability that a single point is inside the triangle formed by the other three is 1/7, then the probability that none are inside is (1 - 1/7)^4 = (6/7)^4 ≈ 0.56. But the options don't have that. So perhaps that approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the probability that a single point is inside the triangle formed by the other three is 1/4, so (3/4)^4 = 81/256 ≈ 0.316, which is close to option F (0.3333) but not exact. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is 1/8, which is 0.125, option A. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is similar to the probability that four points form a convex quadrilateral. In a convex polygon, the probability that four points form a convex quadrilateral is known. Wait, but in a triangle, any four points must have one inside the convex hull of the others, so the probability of forming a convex quadrilateral is zero? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, four points can form a convex quadrilateral if none is inside the convex hull of the others. But in a triangle, how?

Wait, no, in a triangle, if you pick four points, at least one must lie inside the convex hull of the others because the convex hull of three points in a triangle is the triangle itself, and the fourth point can't be outside the original triangle because all points are inside. So, the fourth point must lie inside the convex hull of the three points, which is the triangle formed by them. So, the probability that none of the four points lies inside the triangle formed by the other three is zero. But that can't be right because the options don't include zero.

Wait, but that seems contradictory. Let me think again. If four points are inside a triangle, is it possible that none lies inside the triangle formed by the other three? For example, if all four points are on the edges of the original triangle, not forming a convex quadrilateral. Wait, but in a triangle, any three points form a triangle, and the fourth point can't be outside of that without being on the edge, but if it's on the edge, it's on the convex hull of the other three.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that it's impossible, so the probability is zero. But that's not one of the options. So, perhaps my reasoning is wrong.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the triangle formed by any three points, not necessarily the convex hull. So, perhaps the fourth point can lie outside the triangle formed by three others, but if the three others are arranged in a way that their triangle doesn't cover the entire original triangle, then the fourth point could be outside.

Wait, but in that case, the probability would be the expected value of the area not covered by the triangle formed by three random points, which is 1 - 1/7 = 6/7, and then the probability that the fourth point is outside would be 6/7. But then for four points, it's (6/7)^4, which is about 0.56, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability that a single point lies inside the triangle formed by the other three is 1/4, so (3/4)^4 ≈ 0.316, which is close to option F (0.3333). But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look for known results. I remember that in a triangle, the probability that four points form a convex quadrilateral is 1/3. But that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that all four points are in convex position, meaning that no one lies inside the convex hull of the others. But in a triangle, the convex hull of four points can't be a quadrilateral because the original shape is a triangle. So, the convex hull of four points inside a triangle must be a triangle, meaning at least one point is inside the convex hull of the others. Therefore, the probability that all four points are in convex position (i.e., forming a convex quadrilateral) is zero. But that can't be right because the options don't include zero, so perhaps the problem is different.

Wait, perhaps the triangle formed by the other three is not necessarily the convex hull. So, maybe the fourth point can lie outside the triangle formed by the other three, even if it's inside the original triangle. For example, if the three points are close to one vertex, their triangle is small, and the fourth point is elsewhere in the original triangle but outside that small triangle.

Ah, that makes sense. So, the probability that the fourth point lies inside the triangle formed by the first three is 1/7, as I thought earlier. Therefore, the probability that it doesn't lie inside is 6/7. But since we have four points, and each has to not lie inside the triangle formed by the other three, the probability would be (6/7)^4, but again, this assumes independence, which they're not.

Wait, but maybe because the points are picked independently, the events are independent. So, the probability that none of the four points lies inside the triangle formed by the other three is (6/7)^4 ≈ 0.56. But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the answer is 1/8, which is 0.125, option A. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1/2, option E, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is equivalent to the probability that four points are all in general position, meaning no three are colinear and no one is inside the convex hull of the others. But in a triangle, as I thought earlier, the convex hull of four points must be a triangle, so one point is inside. Therefore, the probability that none is inside the convex hull of the others is zero, which can't be right because the options don't include zero. So, perhaps the problem is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the triangle formed by any three points, not necessarily the convex hull. So, maybe the fourth point can lie outside the triangle formed by three others, even if it's inside the convex hull. For example, if three points are arranged such that their triangle is small, and the fourth is outside that small triangle but still inside the original triangle.

In that case, the probability that the fourth point is inside the triangle formed by the first three is 1/7, so the probability that it's outside is 6/7. Since we have four points, each has a 6/7 chance of being outside the triangle formed by the other three, but these events are not independent.

Wait, but maybe the problem is asking for the probability that all four points are such that each is outside the triangle formed by the other three. So, for each point, it must be outside the triangle formed by the other three. So, for each point, the probability is 6/7, and since the points are independent, the total probability is (6/7)^4 ≈ 0.56, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 1/8, which is 0.125, option A. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Suppose we have four points. The total number of possible configurations is the volume of the 4-dimensional space of points inside the triangle, but that's too abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to the probability that four points are in a certain configuration, and the answer is known to be 1/8. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the probability that a single point is inside the triangle formed by the other three is 1/4. So, the probability that none are inside is (3/4)^4 ≈ 0.316, which is close to option F (0.3333). But I'm not sure if 1/4 is the correct probability.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to make an educated guess. The options are A:0.125, B:0.6667, C:0.4444, D:0.8000, E:0.5000, F:0.3333, G:0.9000, H:0.7500, I:0.1000, J:0.2500.

I think the probability that a single point is inside the triangle formed by the other three is 1/7, so the probability that none are inside is (6/7)^4 ≈ 0.56, which isn't an option. So, perhaps I'm wrong about that.

Alternatively, maybe the probability is 1/4, leading to (3/4)^4 ≈ 0.316, which is close to 0.3333 (option F). Alternatively, perhaps the probability is 1/2, leading to (1/2)^4 = 0.0625, which is option I, but that seems too low.

Wait, another thought: maybe the probability that a single point is inside the triangle formed by the other three is 1/4. So, the probability that none are inside is (3/4)^4 = 81/256 ≈ 0.316, which is roughly 0.3333 (option F). Alternatively, maybe it's 1/3, leading to (2/3)^4 ≈ 0.1975, which is close to option I (0.1000) but not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct probability is 1/8, which is 0.125 (option A), but I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe I should recall that for n points in a triangle, the probability that none lies inside the convex hull of the others is something like 1/(n-1)! or similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 1/8, option A, 0.125. I think I'll go with that.
</think>

The problem involves determining the probability that none of four randomly picked points inside a triangle lies inside the triangle formed by the other three. After considering various approaches, including expected areas, inclusion-exclusion principles, and known probabilities, the reasoning suggests that the probability might be related to the expected value of points lying inside random triangles. While the exact calculation remains unclear, the reasoning leans toward a probability of 0.125, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
