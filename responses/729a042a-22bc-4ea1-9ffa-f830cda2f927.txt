Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the interest rate for an installment plan on an electric guitar. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on finance stuff, but I'll give it a shot.

The guitar's cash value is $90.50. The buyer paid $14.95 down and then makes 8 monthly payments of $10 each. I need to find the interest rate here.

First, I think I should calculate the total amount paid. The down payment is straightforward: $14.95. Then, each of the 8 monthly payments is $10, so that's 8 * $10 = $80. Adding the down payment, the total amount paid is $14.95 + $80 = $94.95.

Wait, that makes sense because the total paid is more than the cash value, so the extra is the interest. Now, the cash value is the present value, and the payments are the future amounts. So this looks like an installment loan problem, probably using the concept of the time value of money.

I remember that installment loans can be analyzed using the concept of simple interest or maybe the add-on method. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it using the present value of an annuity formula. But I'm not entirely sure which approach to take here.

Let me think. The present value (PV) is the cash value, which is $90.50. The payment (PMT) is $10 each month for 8 months. The number of periods (n) is 8, and the interest rate (i) is what we're trying to find.

Wait, but the first payment is made immediately as a down payment, so the first PMT is at time 0, and then the next 7 are monthly. Or is the down payment separate from the installments? Let me clarify. The down payment is $14.95, and then 8 monthly payments of $10. So the down payment is a lump sum, and then each of the 8 payments is monthly. So the first installment is at the end of the first month, right? Or is it at the beginning?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me structure it. The total amount paid by the buyer is $14.95 + 8*$10 = $94.95. So the interest is $94.95 - $90.50 = $4.45. But that's total interest over 8 months. To find the interest rate, I can't just divide by the principal because the principal is being paid down each month.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this as the present value of the installments. So the present value is $90.50, and the payments are an annuity of $10 per month for 8 months. The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Where r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods (8 months). So I can set up the equation:

90.50 = 10 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-8 ) / r ]

I need to solve for r. But solving this equation algebraically is tricky because r is in both the numerator and the exponent. I think I need to use trial and error or a financial calculator. Since I don't have a calculator, I can try estimating.

Let me try option A: 20.3% annually. The monthly rate would be 20.3 / 12 ≈ 1.69%. Let's plug that into the equation.

Compute the factor: [(1 - (1 + 0.0169)^-8 ) / 0.0169]

First, 1.0169^-8: Let me approximate. 1.0169^1 = 1.0169; 1.0169^2 ≈ 1.034; 1.0169^4 ≈ (1.034)^2 ≈ 1.07; 1.0169^8 ≈ (1.07)^2 ≈ 1.145. So 1 / 1.145 ≈ 0.873.

So 1 - 0.873 = 0.127. Then divide by 0.0169: 0.127 / 0.0169 ≈ 7.525.

Multiply by PMT of $10: 7.525 *10 = 75.25. But PV is $90.50, which is higher than 75.25, so the rate must be lower because a lower rate would give a higher present value factor. So 20.3% is too high.

Wait, that can't be right because when I use a higher rate, the present value factor is lower. So if the present value is higher, the rate must be lower. So 20.3% is too high because the calculated PV is lower than $90.50.

Let me try option B: 11.4% annual. Monthly rate is 11.4 / 12 ≈ 0.95% or 0.0095.

Compute [(1 - (1.0095)^-8 ) / 0.0095 ]

First, compute (1.0095)^8. Let's see: 

1.0095^1 = 1.0095
^2 ≈ 1.0190
^4 ≈ (1.0190)^2 ≈ 1.0384
^8 ≈ (1.0384)^2 ≈ 1.0784

So 1 / 1.0784 ≈ 0.927.

1 - 0.927 = 0.073. Divide by 0.0095: 0.073 / 0.0095 ≈ 7.684. 

Multiply by 10: 76.84. But PV should be $90.50, so this is still lower. So 11.4% is too high as well because the present value is lower than 90.50. So I need a lower rate.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again more accurately.

Let me try option C: 17.9% annual. Monthly rate ≈ 17.9/12 ≈ 1.49% or 0.0149.

Compute (1.0149)^8. Let's compute step by step:

1.0149^1 = 1.0149
^2 ≈ 1.0149 * 1.0149 ≈ 1.0301
^4 ≈ (1.0301)^2 ≈ 1.0611
^8 ≈ (1.0611)^2 ≈ 1.126

So 1 / 1.126 ≈ 0.888.

1 - 0.888 = 0.112. Divide by 0.0149: 0.112 / 0.0149 ≈ 7.523.

Multiply by 10: 75.23, which is lower than 90.50. So 17.9% is also too high.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated using the add-on method, where the interest is calculated on the original principal for the entire period.

In that case, the total interest is $4.45 over 8 months. The add-on interest rate would be (Total Interest / Principal) * (12/Period).

Total interest is $4.45, principal is $90.50.

So rate per period: $4.45 / $90.50 ≈ 0.04916 or 4.916% per month.

Wait, that can't be right because that's over 49% annually, which is way higher than the options given. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the installments are an ordinary annuity, and the down payment is separate. So the present value of the 8 monthly payments plus the down payment equals the cash value.

Wait, no. The total amount paid is down payment plus 8 payments. So the present value is $90.50, and the total payments are $14.95 + 8*$10 = $94.95. But perhaps the down payment is a lump sum, so the present value is $90.50, and the installments are 8 payments of $10 each, starting one month from now.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the present value of the 8 payments plus the down payment equals the cash price. But that would be PV of the installments plus down payment equals $90.50. But that doesn't make sense because the down payment is part of the total payments.

Alternatively, perhaps the down payment is part of the total, so the cash price is the present value of the installments plus the down payment. Wait, no, because the down payment is made at time 0, so it's already in present value terms. The installments are future payments, so their present value is what we need to calculate.

So the total present value is $90.50, which equals the down payment plus the present value of the 8 monthly installments.

So, PV = 14.95 + [10 * (1 - (1 + r)^-8) / r ] = 90.50

So, we can set up the equation as:

14.95 + (10 * ((1 - (1 + r)^-8) / r)) = 90.50

Subtracting 14.95 from both sides:

(10 * ((1 - (1 + r)^-8) / r)) = 90.50 - 14.95 = 75.55

So, ((1 - (1 + r)^-8) / r) = 7.555

Now, we need to find r where this equation holds. Let's try the options.

Option A: 20.3% annual, so r = 20.3/12 ≈ 1.6917% per month.

Compute ((1 - 1.016917^-8)/0.016917)

1.016917^8: Let's compute step by step.

1.016917^1 = 1.016917
^2 ≈ 1.03407
^4 ≈ (1.03407)^2 ≈ 1.0693
^8 ≈ (1.0693)^2 ≈ 1.1435

So 1/1.1435 ≈ 0.8743

1 - 0.8743 = 0.1257

0.1257 / 0.016917 ≈ 7.434

But we need 7.555, so this is lower. So r needs to be lower.

Option B: 11.4% annual, r=11.4/12=0.95% or 0.0095.

Compute ((1 - 1.0095^-8)/0.0095)

1.0095^8: let's compute.

1.0095^1 = 1.0095
^2 ≈ 1.0190
^4 ≈ 1.0384
^8 ≈ 1.0783

1/1.0783≈0.9273

1 - 0.9273=0.0727

0.0727 /0.0095≈7.6526

We need 7.555. So 7.65 is higher than 7.555, so r is a bit higher than 0.95%.

So perhaps the rate is between 11.4% and the next higher option. Wait, but the options are given, so let's check the next lower option.

Wait, the options are A:20.3, B:11.4, C:17.9, D:9.8, E:14.2, etc. So perhaps trying E:14.2% annual.

r=14.2/12≈1.1833%

Compute ((1 - 1.011833^-8)/0.011833)

Compute 1.011833^8:

Using approximation:

1.011833^2≈1.0238
^4≈(1.0238)^2≈1.0482
^8≈(1.0482)^2≈1.0987

1/1.0987≈0.9105

1 - 0.9105=0.0895

0.0895 /0.011833≈7.563

That's very close to 7.555. So the rate per month is approximately 1.1833%, which is 14.2% annual.

Wait, but the calculation gave us 7.563, which is slightly higher than 7.555, so perhaps the actual rate is a bit lower than 14.2%. Let me check if option E is 14.2%, which seems to be the closest.

Alternatively, let's try option H:12.5% annual, r=12.5/12≈1.0417%.

Compute 1.010417^8:

1.010417^2≈1.0209
^4≈1.0209^2≈1.0422
^8≈1.0422^2≈1.0862

1/1.0862≈0.921

1 -0.921=0.079

0.079 /0.010417≈7.588

Still higher than 7.555, so the rate is a bit lower than 12.5% annual.

Wait, maybe I need to interpolate between 12.5% and 14.2%. Let's see:

At 12.5% annual, we get 7.588.

At 14.2% annual, we get 7.563.

Wait, but we're looking for 7.555, which is between 7.563 and perhaps a slightly lower rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the present value of the installments without the down payment. Wait, earlier I included the down payment in the present value, but perhaps the down payment is separate, and the PV is only the installments.

Wait, let me clarify. The total amount paid is $14.95 + 8*$10 = $94.95. The cash value is $90.50, so the interest is $4.45 over 8 months.

But when calculating the interest rate for installment plans, it's often based on the average balance or the simple interest on the original principal.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct method is to calculate the effective interest rate using the formula for installment loans, which is:

r = (2 * I * n) / (P * (n + 1))

Where I is the total interest, P is the principal, n is the number of payments.

Wait, let's try that. I = $4.45, P = $90.50, n=8.

So r = (2 * 4.45 *8)/(90.50*(8+1)) = (71.2)/(90.50*9) = 71.2 / 814.5 ≈ 0.0873 or 8.73%. But that's not one of the options, so maybe this method isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the present value of the installments, treating each payment as an annuity.

Wait, going back, the correct formula is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

But in this case, the down payment is separate, so the PV of the installments is $90.50 - $14.95 = $75.55.

So, PV = $75.55 = 10 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-8 ) / r ]

So, ((1 - (1 + r)^-8 ) / r ) = 7.555

Now, let's try the options again.

Option E: 14.2% annual. r = 14.2/12 ≈ 1.1833%.

Compute 1.011833^8:

As before, approximately 1.0987.

1/(1.0987) ≈ 0.9105.

1 - 0.9105 = 0.0895.

0.0895 / 0.011833 ≈ 7.563, which is very close to 7.555. So the rate is approximately 14.2% annual.

Looking back at the options, E is 14.2%, which seems to be the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier when I included the down payment in the PV, the calculation didn't fit. But perhaps I should only consider the installments' present value as $75.55, since the down payment is a separate present amount.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that the total amount paid includes the down payment, so the present value is $90.50, and the total future payments are $94.95. So the interest is $4.45 over 8 months, but the way to calculate the rate is through the present value.

I think the correct answer is E:14.2%.
</think>

To calculate the interest rate for the installment plan, we first determine the total amount paid, which is $14.95 down payment plus 8 monthly payments of $10 each, totaling $94.95. The cash value of the guitar is $90.50, so the total interest is $94.95 - $90.50 = $4.45 over 8 months.

Using the present value of an annuity formula:

\[
PV = PMT \times \left( \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \right)
\]

where \( PV = 90.50 \), \( PMT = 10 \), and \( n = 8 \), we solve for \( r \). Rearranging:

\[
\left( \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-8}}{r} \right) = 7.555
\]

By testing the options, we find that an annual interest rate of **14.2%** (monthly rate ≈ 1.1833%) satisfies the equation, as it yields a present value factor close to 7.555. Thus, the correct answer is:

**E: 14.2%**

Answer: E
