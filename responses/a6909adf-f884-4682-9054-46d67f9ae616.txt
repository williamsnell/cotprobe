Alright, so I've got this question about US adults and their opinions on criminal risk assessment algorithms used for parole decisions. The question is asking what percentage of adults, as of 2018, believe this application is unreasonable. The options are A through J, with various percentages.

First, I need to recall any information I know about public opinion on algorithmic decision-making in the criminal justice system. I remember that there's been a lot of discussion about bias and fairness in algorithms, especially in areas like parole and sentencing. Some studies suggest that the public might be concerned about the use of such tools because they could perpetuate or even exacerbate existing biases.

Looking at the options, the percentages range from 15% to 90%. I'm trying to think if there was a specific survey or study from around 2018 that reported on this. I think the Pew Research Center or maybe a Gallup poll might have covered this topic. From what I vaguely remember, a significant portion of the population is skeptical about technology in decision-making, especially in sensitive areas like criminal justice.

I'm trying to recall if the percentage was in the majority or minority. If a majority felt it was unreasonable, that would be above 50%. Options like A (71%), E (64%), I (56%) are all above 50%. On the other hand, options like B (49%), F (33%), etc., are lower.

I think a study found that a majority of Americans are uncomfortable with algorithms making important decisions, including in areas like hiring, healthcare, and criminal justice. If that's the case, then the percentage should be over 50%. So, looking at the options, A is 71%, E is 64%, I is 56%. Which of these is more likely?

I'm not entirely sure about the exact number, but I think it's around 60-70%. Maybe 64% is a possible figure. Alternatively, 71% seems high but possible given the concerns about bias.

Wait, another angle: the question specifies "criminal risk assessment for people up for parole." This is a specific use case. I wonder if the percentage is higher or lower than general algorithmic concerns. Maybe people are more concerned about criminal justice applications, so perhaps the percentage is higher than average.

If I had to guess, I think maybe around 60-70% might be the right range. So looking at the options, E is 64%, which is in that range. Alternatively, A is 71%, which is also possible. I'm a bit torn between these two.

Wait, another thought: there was a 2018 study by the Knight Foundation or something similar that looked into public trust in algorithms. I think they found that a majority of people, like over 60%, have concerns about algorithms in criminal justice. So maybe 64% is the correct answer, which is option E.

Alternatively, maybe it's 71%, but I'm not certain. I'll go with the 64% because that seems to fit with what I remember about the studies from that period.

The answer is E: 64%.
