Question:

The surface of the Sun has a temperature close to 6,000 K and it emits a blackbody (Planck) spectrum that reaches a maximum near 500 nm. For a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K, at what wavelength would the thermal spectrum reach a maximum?

Options:

A: 10 mm
B: 1,000 nm
C: 10,000 nm
D: 1 m
E: 1 cm
F: 10 cm
G: 10:00 PM
H: 100 Pm
I: 100 mm
J: 500 nm

Okay, so I have this question about the Sun's temperature and the wavelength where the thermal spectrum reaches its maximum. Hmm, I remember something about blackbody radiation and something called Wien's Law. Let me think.

The question says the Sun's surface is about 6,000 K, and the max emission is near 500 nm. Oh right, Wien's Law relates the temperature of a blackbody to the wavelength where it emits most intensely. The formula is lambda_max * T = constant. I think the constant is around 2.9 x 10^-3 m·K. 

So, for the Sun, lambda_max = (2.9e-3 m·K) / 6000 K. Let me calculate that. 2.9e-3 divided by 6000. Well, 6000 is 6e3, so 2.9e-3 /6e3 = approximately 4.83e-7 meters, which is 483 nm. That's close to 500 nm, so that checks out.

Now the question is about a body at 300 K. Using the same formula, lambda_max = (2.9e-3) / 300. Let's see, 300 is 3e2. So 2.9e-3 /3e2 = (2.9 /3) * 1e-5. 2.9 divided by 3 is about 0.9667, so 0.9667e-5 meters. Wait, 1e-5 meters is 10 micrometers, or 10,000 nm. So 0.9667e-5 meters is about 9667 nm, which is roughly 10,000 nm. Looking at the options, option C is 10,000 nm. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the formula is lambda_max = (2.9e-3 m·K)/T. For T=300 K, 2.9e-3 /300 = 0.000009667 meters, which is 9.667e-6 meters, or 9667 nm. So yes, that's about 10,000 nm. 

Looking at the options again: option B is 1000 nm (which is infrared), option C is 10,000 nm (which is infrared too but a longer wavelength), and others like 10 mm is 10,000 nm wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 mm is 1e-3 m, which is 1000 nm. Wait, wait, let me convert everything properly. 

Wait, 1 nm is 1e-9 meters. So 10,000 nm is 1e-5 meters. Oh wait, that's 10 micrometers, which is in the infrared range. So the maximum emission for 300 K would be around 10,000 nm. So the correct answer should be option C.

The surface temperature of the Sun is approximately 6,000 K, and its thermal spectrum reaches a maximum near 500 nm, consistent with Wien's Law. For a body with a surface temperature of 300 K, the wavelength at which the thermal spectrum reaches its maximum can be calculated using the same law. Applying Wien's Law, the maximum wavelength is approximately 10,000 nm. 

Answer: C
