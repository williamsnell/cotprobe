Okay, so I have this question about finding the standard deviation of a sample. The data given is 1, 3, 7, 10, 14. I'm a bit rusty on statistics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that standard deviation measures how spread out the numbers are. To calculate it, I think I need to find the mean first, then subtract the mean from each data point, square those differences, find the average of those squared differences (which is the variance), and then take the square root of that variance to get the standard deviation.

Let me start by calculating the mean. The mean is the sum of all measurements divided by the number of measurements. So, adding up the numbers: 1 + 3 is 4, plus 7 is 11, plus 10 is 21, plus 14 is 35. There are 5 numbers, so the mean is 35 divided by 5, which is 7. Okay, the mean is 7.

Next, I need to subtract the mean from each measurement and square the result. Let's do that.

First measurement: 1. 1 minus 7 is -6. Squared is 36.
Second: 3 minus 7 is -4. Squared is 16.
Third: 7 minus 7 is 0. Squared is 0.
Fourth: 10 minus 7 is 3. Squared is 9.
Fifth: 14 minus 7 is 7. Squared is 49.

Now, I add up these squared differences: 36 + 16 is 52, plus 0 is 52, plus 9 is 61, plus 49 is 110. So the sum of squared differences is 110.

Since this is a sample, I think I should use the sample variance formula, which divides by (n-1) instead of n. Here, n is 5, so n-1 is 4. So the variance is 110 divided by 4, which is 27.5.

Now, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. So I need to find the square root of 27.5. Let me think. I know that 5 squared is 25 and 6 squared is 36, so it's between 5 and 6. Let's try 5.24 squared: 5.24 * 5.24 is about 27.4576, which is very close to 27.5. So the square root is approximately 5.24.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 5.24. Let me check the options again. The options are A:5.92, B:2.87, C:7.1, D:3.5, E:4.24, F:4.69, G:6.32, H:5.5, I:5.07, J:6.5.

Hmm, I got 5.24, but that's not an option. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me go through the steps again. Maybe I messed up the variance calculation. Wait, wait—when I subtracted the mean and squared, I got 36, 16, 0, 9, 49. Adding those gives 36+16=52, 52+0=52, 52+9=61, 61+49=110. That seems right. So sum of squares is 110.

Now, for sample standard deviation, we divide by n-1, which is 4, so 110/4 is 27.5. Square root of 27.5 is approximately 5.24. But that's not an option. Wait, maybe I should have used population variance instead of sample variance? Let me check.

If I divide by n instead of n-1, the variance would be 110/5 =22. Then the standard deviation is sqrt(22), which is around 4.69. Oh, that's option F. But wait, the question says it's a sample, so I should use n-1. Hmm, but maybe the question is considering population standard deviation.

Wait, let me think. The question says "sample of measurements." So in statistics, when the data is a sample, the standard deviation is calculated using the sample variance, which uses n-1. So I think my initial approach was correct, but that's not matching the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate the square root of 27.5. Let me do it more accurately. 5.24 squared is 5.24 *5.24. Let me compute that:

5*5=25
5*0.24=1.2
0.24*5=1.2
0.24*0.24=0.0576

So 5.24 *5.24 = (5 +0.24)^2 = 5^2 + 2*5*0.24 + 0.24^2 =25 + 2.4 +0.0576=27.4576. So sqrt(27.5) is approximately 5.244, so about 5.24. But that's not an option. The closest option is H:5.5, but that's higher. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the variance.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the population variance. Let me try that. So variance would be 110/5=22. Then sqrt(22) is about 4.69, which is option F. But the question says it's a sample, so I'm confused. Maybe the options are considering population standard deviation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares. Let me check again:

1-7=-6, squared 36.

3-7=-4, squared 16.

7-7=0, squared 0.

10-7=3, squared 9.

14-7=7, squared 49.

Sum:36+16=52, +0=52, +9=61, +49=110. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for sample standard deviation, which is sqrt[(sum of squares)/(n-1)]. So sqrt(110/4)=sqrt(27.5)=5.244, which is approximately 5.24. But that's not an option. The options don't have 5.24.

Wait, looking at the options again, E is 4.24, F is 4.69, H is5.5, I is5.07.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the mean. Let me recalculate the mean.

1+3=4, +7=11, +10=21, +14=35. 35 divided by 5 is 7. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the sum of squares. Let me check each squared term again.

1: (1-7)^2=36.

3: (3-7)^2=16.

7: (7-7)^2=0.

10: (10-7)^2=9.

14: (14-7)^2=49.

Yes, sum is 36+16=52, +0=52, +9=61, +49=110.

Hmm, perhaps the options are using population standard deviation, so sqrt(22)=4.69, which is option F. Maybe the question is considering population, but the wording says 'sample', so I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the variance calculation. Wait, wait—no, 110 divided by 4 is 27.5. So sqrt(27.5) is about 5.24, but that's not an option. The closest is H:5.5, but that's higher.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(27.5).

I know that 5.24^2 is 27.4576, as I did before. So 5.24^2=27.4576, which is just a bit less than 27.5. So sqrt(27.5) is about 5.242. So approximately 5.24.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the data is a sample or the entire population. The question says it's a sample, so I should use n-1. So standard deviation is sqrt(27.5)=5.24.

But since that's not an option, maybe I should consider that perhaps the question is using population standard deviation. Let me see.

If I use n=5, variance is 110/5=22. sqrt(22)=4.690 approximately. So that's option F:4.69.

Looking back at the options, F is 4.69. So perhaps the question expects the population standard deviation, not the sample's. Maybe the wording is a bit tricky. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the steps.

Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the sum of squares. Let me double-check.

1: (1-7)^2=36.

3: (3-7)^2=16.

7:0.

10: 3^2=9.

14:7^2=49.

Sum:36+16=52, +9=61, +49=110. That's correct.

So the sum is 110.

Sample variance: 110/4=27.5. sqrt(27.5)=5.24.

Population variance:110/5=22. sqrt(22)=4.69.

So the options have F as 4.69. So perhaps the question wants the population standard deviation.

But the question says "sample of measurements," so I thought it should be sample standard deviation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the options are rounded. Let me see. 5.24 is approximately 5.24, but none of the options match that. Option I is 5.07, which is lower. Option H is5.5, which is higher. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it using another method. Let me try calculating the standard deviation step by step.

Another way: mean is 7.

Each term:

(1-7)^2=36.

(3-7)^2=16.

(7-7)^2=0.

(10-7)^2=9.

(14-7)^2=49.

Sum of squares:110.

Sample variance:110/(5-1)=27.5.

Sample standard deviation:sqrt(27.5)=5.24.

But if I take the square root using a calculator, sqrt(27.5)=5.244, which rounds to 5.24. Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the question is asking for population or sample. The question says "sample of measurements," so I think it's a sample, so sample standard deviation.

But since 5.24 isn't an option, maybe I made a mistake in the sum of squares. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the squared differences.

Wait, 1: (1-7)^2 = (-6)^2=36. Correct.

3: (3-7)=(-4)^2=16. Correct.

7:0. Correct.

10: (10-7)=3. 3^2=9. Correct.

14: (14-7)=7. 7^2=49. Correct.

So sum is 36+16+0+9+49=110. That's correct.

So I'm confident that the sample standard deviation is sqrt(27.5)=5.24.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option F:4.69, assuming population standard deviation.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute sqrt(27.5) more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(27.5):

I know that 5^2=25, 5.2^2=27.04, 5.3^2=28.09.

So 5.2^2=27.04.

5.24^2=5.2^2 + 2*5.2*0.04 + 0.04^2=27.04 + 0.416 +0.0016=27.4576.

5.24^2=27.4576.

5.245^2= (5.24 +0.005)^2=5.24^2 + 2*5.24*0.005 +0.005^2=27.4576 +0.0524 +0.000025=27.510025.

So sqrt(27.5)= approximately 5.244, which is about 5.24.

So that's correct.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is 5.24, but it's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps the options are wrong.

Wait, looking at the options again, option E is 4.24, F is4.69, H is5.5, I is5.07.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the sum. Let me add the squared differences again.

36 (from 1) +16 (from 3)=52.

+0 (from7)=52.

+9 (from10)=61.

+49 (from14)=110.

Yes, that's correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest is option F:4.69, which would be the population standard deviation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the variance, but no, the question asks for standard deviation.

Hmm. I'm confused. Maybe I should go with the sample standard deviation as 5.24, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 5.07 (option I), but I don't see how that would be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mean. Let me recalculate the mean.

1+3=4, +7=11, +10=21, +14=35. 35/5=7. Correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the absolute deviations instead of squared, but no, standard deviation uses squared.

Alternatively, maybe I should use a different formula, like the formula that doesn't require calculating the mean first. But I don't think that's possible; the standard deviation always requires the mean.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula where you sum the squares of each number, then subtract n times the square of the mean, then divide by n-1, then take square root.

Let me try that.

Sum of squares:1^2=1, 3^2=9,7^2=49,10^2=100,14^2=196.

Sum:1+9=10, +49=59, +100=159, +196=355.

Sum of squares is 355.

Now, n=5, mean is7, mean squared is49.

n*mean squared=5*49=245.

Sum of squares minus n*mean squared=355-245=110. Which matches what I had before.

So variance is 110/(n-1)=27.5, standard deviation sqrt(27.5)=5.24.

Again, same result.

So I'm confident that the sample standard deviation is 5.24, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the options are wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the population standard deviation, which would be sqrt(22)=4.69, which is option F.

Given that 4.69 is an option, and perhaps the question intended to ask for population standard deviation, I think the intended answer is F:4.69.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

So, I'll go with option F:4.69 as the answer.

To find the standard deviation of the sample measurements 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the mean (average):**  
   Mean = (1 + 3 + 7 + 10 + 14) / 5 = 35 / 5 = 7.

2. **Compute the squared differences from the mean:**  
   - (1 - 7)² = 36  
   - (3 - 7)² = 16  
   - (7 - 7)² = 0  
   - (10 - 7)² = 9  
   - (14 - 7)² = 49  

   Sum of squared differences = 36 + 16 + 0 + 9 + 49 = 110.

3. **Calculate the variance:**  
   Since this is a sample, we use the sample variance formula, which divides by (n - 1):  
   Variance = 110 / (5 - 1) = 110 / 4 = 27.5.

4. **Find the standard deviation:**  
   Standard deviation = √27.5 ≈ 5.24.

However, none of the provided options match 5.24. If we instead calculate the **population standard deviation** (dividing by n instead of n - 1):  
   Variance = 110 / 5 = 22.  
   Standard deviation = √22 ≈ 4.69, which corresponds to **option F**.

Given the options, it appears the question may be asking for the population standard deviation. Therefore, the best answer is:

**Answer: F**
