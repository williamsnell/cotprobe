Okay, so I have this problem about estimating the amount of tin in a closed tin can. The can has a diameter of 8 cm and a height of 12 cm, and the tin is 0.04 cm thick. I need to use differentials to approximate the volume of tin used. Hmm, I remember that differentials can be used for approximations when the change in variables is small. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me visualize the tin can. It's a cylinder, right? So the volume of a cylinder is given by V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. But wait, that's the volume of the can, but I need the volume of the tin, which is the material thickness. So I think I need to find the volume of the tin by considering the thickness of the tin layer.

The can is closed, so it has both a top and a bottom. So the tin forms a cylindrical shell with top and bottom. The thickness is 0.04 cm everywhere. To find the volume of tin, maybe I can find the outer volume minus the inner volume. But since the thickness is small, using differentials can simplify this calculation without having to compute the exact volumes.

Let me recall how differentials work for approximations. If I have a function y = f(x), then the differential dy is approximately equal to f’(x) dx, where dx is a small change in x. In this case, the volume V depends on r and h, but here the thickness affects both the radius and the height. Wait, but in this problem, the height of the can is given as 12 cm, and the diameter is 8 cm, so the radius is 4 cm. The tin thickness affects the radius and the height of the can. Wait, actually, the height of the can includes the thickness of the top and bottom. So when the can is made, the height is the internal height plus twice the thickness (since the top and bottom each have a thickness). Hmm, maybe I should model the volume as a function of radius and height, then take differentials with respect to both.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to think of the tin can as a cylinder with inner radius r and outer radius R = r + Δr, where Δr is the thickness of the tin. Similarly, the height of the can is h, but the tin adds a bit to the height because of the top and bottom. Wait, but the problem states the height is 12 cm, which I think is the internal height. So the actual height of the can including the tin would be h + 2Δr, because the top and bottom each add Δr to the height. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the can as having an inner volume Vi and an outer volume Vo. The volume of tin would then be Vo - Vi.

So let's compute Vi and Vo. The inner radius ri is 8 cm diameter / 2 = 4 cm, inner height hi is 12 cm. The outer radius ro is ri + Δr = 4 + 0.04 = 4.04 cm. The outer height ho is hi + 2Δr because the top and bottom each add Δr, so 12 + 2*0.04 = 12.08 cm. Then the tin volume would be Vo - Vi = π(ro² ho) - π(ri² hi) = π[(ro² ho) - (ri² hi)]. But this might not be the correct approach because the differentials method is supposed to approximate this difference.

Alternatively, using differentials, I can approximate the change in volume when r changes by dr = 0.04 cm and h changes by dh = 0.08 cm (since the top and bottom each add 0.04 cm to the height, so total change is 0.08 cm). So the differential dV would be the sum of the partial derivatives times their respective changes.

Wait, but wait, the height change might not be 0.08 cm because the can's height is 12 cm, which is the internal height. So the total height including the tin would be 12 + 2*0.04 = 12.08 cm, so the change in height is 0.08 cm. So dh = 0.08 cm.

So, the function V(r, h) = π r² h. The differential dV is (∂V/∂r) dr + (∂V/∂h) dh. Let me compute the partial derivatives.

∂V/∂r = 2π r h
∂V/∂h = π r²

So, plugging in r = 4 cm, h = 12 cm, dr = 0.04 cm, dh = 0.08 cm.

dV = (2π*4*12)*0.04 + (π*4²)*0.08
Let me compute each part:

First term: 2π *4*12 = 96π. Multiply by 0.04: 96π *0.04 = 3.84π cm³.

Second term: π*16 = 16π. Multiply by 0.08: 16π *0.08 = 1.28π cm³.

Adding them together: 3.84π + 1.28π = 5.12π. So dV ≈ 5.12π cm³. Let's compute that numerically. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 5.12 *3.1416 ≈ let's see:

5 *3.1416 = 15.708
0.12 *3.1416 ≈ 0.376992
Adding together: 15.708 + 0.376992 ≈ 16.084992 cm³. So approximately 16.08 cm³.

Looking at the options, option I is 16 cm³. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check if I correctly accounted for the height change.

Wait, another approach: the tin can's walls have a thickness of 0.04 cm. So the volume of the tin would include the lateral surface area times the thickness, plus the top and bottom areas times the thickness. Let me compute that and see if it aligns.

The lateral surface area of a cylinder is 2πr h. The area of the top and bottom is 2πr². So the tin's volume would be:

Lateral: 2πr h * dr (dr is 0.04 cm)
Plus top and bottom: 2πr² * dr * 2 (since top and bottom each contribute a volume of πr² * dr, so total 2πr² dr)
Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The top and bottom each have an area of πr², and the thickness is dr, so each contributes πr² * dr. So two of them give 2πr² dr.

So total tin volume is:

(2πr h dr) + (2πr² dr) = 2πr dr (h + r)

Plugging in r=4, dr=0.04, h=12.

So that's 2π *4 *0.04*(12 +4) = 2π*4*0.04*16.

Compute this:

2*4 =8; 8*0.04=0.32; 0.32*16=5.12. So 5.12π ≈ 16.08 cm³, same as before.

So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 16 cm³, which is option I.

To estimate the amount of tin using differentials, model the can's volume as a function of radius \( r \) and height \( h \): \( V = \pi r^2 h \). The tin's thickness \( dr = 0.04 \, \text{cm} \) affects both the radius and height. The height increases by \( dh = 0.08 \, \text{cm} \) due to the top and bottom. The differential \( dV \) is:

\[
dV = \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} dr + \frac{\partial V}{\partial h} dh = (2\pi r h) dr + (\pi r^2) dh
\]

Substituting \( r = 4 \, \text{cm} \), \( h = 12 \, \text{cm} \), \( dr = 0.04 \, \text{cm} \), and \( dh = 0.08 \, \text{cm} \):

\[
dV = (2\pi \cdot 4 \cdot 12) \cdot 0.04 + (\pi \cdot 4^2) \cdot 0.08 = 3.84\pi + 1.28\pi = 5.12\pi \approx 16.08 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

Thus, the estimated volume of tin is approximately \( 16 \, \text{cm}^3 \).
