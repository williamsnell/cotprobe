Question:

Mr. Errol makes deliveries by bicycle for a living and earns $200 a week. He is currently taxed at a rate of 20%. Be-cause of his superior work record, his boss gave Mr. Errol a $10 raise in pay. Mr. Errol is excited, but does not realize that this raise in pay puts him in a 25% tax bracket. a) How much of an increase in take-home salary does this raise amount to? b) Discuss Mr. Errol's marginal tax rate.

Options:

A: Increase in pay of $2.50, Marginal tax rate of 20%
B: Drop in pay of $10, Marginal tax rate of 200%
C: Increase in pay of $5, Marginal tax rate of 25%
D: Drop in pay of $5, Marginal tax rate of 75%
E: Increase in pay of $2.50, Marginal tax rate of 50%
F: Drop in pay of $2.50, Marginal tax rate of 125%
G: Increase in pay of $7.50, Marginal tax rate of 20%
H: No change in pay, Marginal tax rate of 25%
I: Increase in pay of $7.50, Marginal tax rate of 25%
J: Increase in pay of $10, Marginal tax rate of 25%

Okay, so I've got this problem about Mr. Errol and his tax situation after a raise. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

First, Mr. Errol earns $200 a week and is taxed at 20%. So, his current take-home pay is 200 minus 20% tax. Let me calculate that: 20% of 200 is 40, so he takes home 160 each week.

Then, he gets a $10 raise, making his new weekly pay $210. But here's the catch: this raise pushes him into a higher tax bracket of 25%. Now, I need to figure out how much his take-home pay increases and what his marginal tax rate is.

Wait, but how does the tax bracket work here? Is the entire $210 taxed at 25%, or only the portion that exceeds the previous threshold? Hmm, the problem says he's taxed at 25% because of the raise, so I think it implies that his entire new income is taxed at 25%. Or maybe only the raise amount is taxed at 25%? That's a bit unclear. Let me read the question again.

It says the raise puts him in a 25% tax bracket, so I think that means the new amount is taxed at 25%. So his new tax would be 25% of 210. Let me calculate that: 25% of 210 is 52.5. So his new take-home pay is 210 - 52.5 = 157.5.

Wait, but that can't be right because his take-home pay would actually decrease. That doesn't make sense because he got a raise. I must be misunderstanding something. Perhaps only the portion of the raise that's above a certain threshold is taxed at 25%, not the entire income. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the tax brackets work such that up to a certain amount is taxed at 20%, and anything above is taxed at 25%. But the problem doesn't specify the threshold. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the raise itself is taxed at 25%. So the $10 raise is taxed at 25%, meaning he pays 2.5 in tax on that part. So his new take-home would be 200*(1-0.20) + 10*(1-0.25) = 160 + 7.5 = 167.5. So his increase in take-home is 167.5 - 160 = 7.5. So the increase is $7.5, and his marginal tax rate on the raise is 25%, but the overall tax rate is a bit different.

Wait, but the question asks for the increase in take-home salary. So before the raise, he had $160. After, if only the raise is taxed at 25%, he gets 160 + 10*(0.75) = 160 + 7.5 = 167.5. So the increase is $7.5. So that would correspond to option I: Increase of $7.50, Marginal tax rate of 25%. But wait, the marginal tax rate is the rate at which the next dollar is taxed, which is 25%. So the marginal rate is 25%. But looking at the options, option I says increase $7.50 and marginal tax rate 25%, which seems correct.

Alternatively, if the entire new income is taxed at 25%, his take-home would be 210*0.75=157.5, which is less than before. That would mean a decrease, but that's not one of the options. So I think the correct approach is that only the raise is taxed at 25%, so he pays 2.50 more in tax, and his take-home increases by 7.50.

So part a) is an increase of $7.50, and part b) is a marginal tax rate of 25%. Looking at the options, option I is "Increase of $7.50, Marginal tax rate of 25%", which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check. The marginal tax rate is the rate at which the last dollar earned is taxed. So if his raise pushes him into a higher bracket, the marginal rate is 25%. So yes, the marginal tax rate is 25%.

The correct answer is **I: Increase in pay of $7.50, Marginal tax rate of 25%**

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Earnings and Tax:**
   - Mr. Errol earns $200/week.
   - Tax rate: 20%.
   - Take-home pay: $200 - (20% of $200) = $160.

2. **Raise and New Earnings:**
   - He receives a $10 raise, making new earnings $210/week.
   - The raise pushes him into a 25% tax bracket.

3. **Tax on the Raise:**
   - The $10 raise is taxed at 25%.
   - Tax on raise: 25% of $10 = $2.50.
   - Take-home from raise: $10 - $2.50 = $7.50.

4. **New Take-Home Pay:**
   - Original take-home: $160.
   - Additional take-home from raise: $7.50.
   - New take-home: $160 + $7.50 = $167.50.

5. **Increase in Take-Home:**
   - Increase: $167.50 - $160 = $7.50.

6. **Marginal Tax Rate:**
   - The marginal tax rate is 25% (the rate at which the additional income is taxed).

**Answer: I**
